IT must be about twenty years since I tried to
foretell the future of Individual Psychology in
some such words as these. Individual Psychology,
which is essentially a child of this age, will have a
permanent influence on the thought, poetry and
dreams of humanity. It will attract many en-
lightened disciples, and many more who will
hardly know the names of its pioneers. It will be
understood by some, but the number of those who
misunderstand it will be greater. It will have
many adherents, and still more enemies. Because
of its simplicity many will think it too easy, whereas
those who know it will recognize how difficult it is.
It will bring its followers neither wealth nor
position, but they will have the satisfaction of
learning from their opponents’ mistakes. It will
draw a dividing line between those who use their
knowledge for the purpose of establishing an ideal
community, and those who do not. It will give
its followers such keenness of vision that no corner
of the human soul will be hidden from them and
it will ensure that this hard-earned capacity shall
be placed in the service of human progress.
</p><p>
The author of this book is well fitted to speak
in the name of Individual Psychology. His life,
his work, his first book on Psychic Impotence
(published by S. Hirzel, Leipzig) are all evidences
of a mode of thought which is characterized by
acceptance of Individual Psychology, enthusiasm
for co-operation and specialized knowledge. It
may well be that the introduction of his new book
will disclose to many darkened minds the secrets
after which they are groping.

THE COMMUNITY FEELING 
<a href="#CONTENTS">(UP)</a>
</h2>

<p>
WHAT forms the character of a human being ?
What makes a man act as he does? What forces
govern all the activities of the human mind ?
These are the fundamental questions which
psychology tries to answer. So many people are
now exploring them and there are so many theories
that we are apt to feel confused. Some people
assume that the life of each individual is determined
by the experiences and desires of his ancestors
(Jung),.. Others regard the Psyche as the battle-
field of the most various instincts, corresponding
to various forms of the sexual instinct (The Psycho-
Analysis of Freud). Many think that the most
complicated behaviour patterns are the outcome
of the automatic action of certain reflex mechan-
isms, which are built up and maintained by habit
(The Reflexology of Bechterev) Others look upon
man with all his functions as the mere product of
his environment, which through the medium of
education directs his behaviour (The Behaviourism
of Watson). A number of other theories have been
advanced by different pioneers in order to explain
psychic phenomena. “he leading idea of the
Individual P8ychology of Alfred Adler is found in
his recognition of the importance of human society,
not only for the development of individual char-
acter, but also for the orientation of every single
action and emotion in the life of a human being.
</p><p>
There are certain species that cannot exist
without close contact with their kind. Man
belongs to these. Nature has not fitted him to
fight singlehanded. He is not equipped in the
same way as other animals for the struggle for
existence. He neither has weapons of attack in
the form of sharp teeth, great physical strength and
powerful claws, nor is he able to defend his life by
extraordinary swiftness or inconspicuous smallness.
It seems that men formed herds exactly like other
herding animals simply because this was necessary
in order to preserve existence <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.
</p>

<p id="footnote1"><i>
[1] It is a well-known fact that birds fitted to share the struggle
for existence and to rear their young in pairs, gather together
in flocks before undertaking the difficult task which a long
journey involves. Likewise weak, defenceless amimals form
herds in order to organize a better defence. The formation of a
community is a very effective way of preserving existence, and
therefore it is often adopted, but it is not the only way. Animals
similar to those living in communities are also frequently found
leading a solitary mode of existence.</i>
</p>

<p>
Most of us have no adequate idea of the extent
to which man nowadays depends on co-operation
with his fellow men. We have only to think of the
thousands of people whose labour we employ each
day, or need only consider how many people have
co-operated to provide our houses, clothing, food,
and a thousand other necessities of our daily lives.
For centuries man has lived in more or less close
social relations with his fellow men and has adapted
himself to a system of division of labour and mutual
assistance. During infancy the human child is
one of the most defenceless creatures in the world.
He cannot find his food without help, nor even walk
alone. In exercising all his functions he depends
on the co-operation of others.
</p><p>
The question now arises: fo what exfent can
living in a closely knit community form the
character of an individual ? It might seem, as
the Psycho-Analysis of Freud maintains, that
buman instincts adapt themselves only 'incom-
pletely and faultily to the reality of close social
relationships, and that the human Psyche is indeed
at the mercy of incompatible demands—the need
for adjustment to the community, and the needs
of innate instincts. Nevertheless, observation
shows that not only among men, but also among
animals, close social relationships, with the very
delicate adjustment to the claims of others which
is involved in such relationships, decisively affect
the nature and characteristics of species, and even
enable some individuals to revolt against laws of
nature which otherwise prove generally irresistible.
All living creatures feel a compulsion to maintain
life, which causes them to seek for food, and a desire
to propagate themselves, which finds its fulfilment
in love. And yet under certain circumstances men
refuse to obey their natural instincts. Children
may choose to starve themselves if they think such
tactics are the best they can adopt in a struggle
with their parents. Prisoners starve themselves
as a form of protest. Thousands upon thousands
of _people who. wish to.evade the claims of a love
relationship_suppress every sexual emotion. Man
has tamed his natural instincts and subordinated
them to his attitude to his environment, and we
find that the bees go to even greater lengths.
They have reduced the sexual instinct—otherwise
an all-powerful instinct, dominating the whole
sphere of nature—to a precisely ordered function,
which they regulate in accordance with the needs
of their commonwealth at any given moment.
They not only command means enabling them to
decide arbitrarily whether they will produce males
or females, but they can also allot the sexual
function to certain individuals and later deprive
them of it. Thus even creatures like bees, who
live in the most closely knit communities known
to us, can reverse generally valid biological laws.
This supports Alfred Adler’s view of the importance
of society for the development of individual
character among human beings.
</p><p>
When we observe people we find that the nature,
character and_actions of an_individual are determined
 by the experiences he encounters in. the
community within which he grows up. Here we
seem to approach Watson’s theory of Behaviourism
according to which man is the mere product of
his environment. But if we look deeper we find
that in addition to the influence of environment
another vitally important circumstance remains to
be considered. Different people respond in different
 ways to the same experiences and influences.
Man does not merely react. He adopts an individual
attitude. The attitude adopted depends on the
impressions the individual forms in early childhood.
Environment is indeed a determining factor. Yet
this environment is not the individual’s real
environment, but merely his environment as it
appears subjectively to him. Therefore the decisive
factor for the development of character is not the
influence of environment, but the attitude to
environment which the individual takes up. Man
develops his characteristic behaviour—his 
character—solely by opposition or support, negation
or affirmation, acceptance or non-acceptance.
</p><p>
Man’s urge to adapt himself to the arbitrary
conditions of his environment is expressed by the
community feeling innate in every human being.
Its roots go centuries deep. But this innate social
characteristic, which is common to all, must be
developed if the individual is to be qualified to
fulfil the complicated demands of the community
in which the civilized adult lives.
</p><p>
The human community sets three tasks for every
individual. They are: work, which means doing,
useful work, friendship, which embraces social,
relationships with comrades and relatives, and love,
which is the most intimate union with some one of
the other sex and represents the strongest emotional
relationship which can exist between two human
beings.
</p><p>
These three tasks embrace the whole of human
life with all its desires and activities. All human
suffering originates from the difficulties which 
complicate the tasks. The possibility of fulfilling them
does not depend on the individual’s talents nor on
his intelligence. Men of outstanding capacity fail
where others with far inferior powers achieve
relative successes. It all depends on community
feeling. The better this is developed and the
happier the relationship between the individual
and the human community, the more successfully
does he fulfil the three life tasks, and the better
balanced his character and nature appear.
</p><p>
The community feeling is expressed subjectively
in the consciousness of having something in common
with other people and of being one of them. People
can develop their capacity for co-operation only if
they feel that in spite of all external dissimilarities
they are not fundamentally different from other
people. A man’s ability to co-operate may therefore
 be regarded as a measure of the development
of his community feeling.
</p><p>
A specific example will help us to visualize the
situation more clearly : A man becomes a member
of a group, a club, a political party or some other
association. His community feeli'ﬁg expresses
itself subjectively in his consciousness of membership.
 Expressed objectively it will show how far
he is able to co-operate in life, On his community
feeling depends how soon he makes contact with
others, whether and to what extent he can adapt
himself to others, whether he is capable of entering
into other people’s feelings and of understanding
other people. A man who thinks only of himself,
of how he is to uphold his own dignity and of the
part he means to play, is sure to cause trouble
within his circle of friends and acquaintances.
</p><p>
Readiness to co-operate, which is one of the
characteristics of a good comrade, is tested most
rigorously in difficult situations. Most people are
perfectly willing to co-operate so long as everything
is to their liking. It is much more difficult to
remain a good comrade in an uncongenial situation.
If the tie which binds a man to a community is
weak, he will easily break away as soon as anything
he does not like happens. The stronger his feeling
of membership, the more surely will he remain loyal
to the community, even when he cannot enforce
his own wishes. We never find conditions which
entirely conform to our wishes in any human re-
lationship, be it friendship, the family, love or work.
Sooner or later, therefore, we are bound to become
involved in critical situations, and the way we
behave then will show whether we are community
minded or not.
</p><p>
Another characteristic of the good comrade is his
readiness to demand less than he offers. Nowadays
most people brought up in large towns are spoilt
children, who measure their happiness and satisfaction
 only by what they get. This is a grave
error, for which thousands pay in unhappiness and
suffering. People who make it their object to get
as much as possible are always clutching emptiness.
They are insatiable. Only a rare and brief moment
of attainment rewards months or years of covetousness
 and ambition. None but those who can seek
their happiness as a part of the whole, that is to
say, in the contribution they themselves can make
to the community, can feel satisfied with themselves
and their lives. The community feeling therefore
is expressed by willingness to contribute without
thought of reward.
</p><p>
We shall have a sufficiently reliable criterion as
to whether any given action takes into account
the needs of the community, if we observe to what
extent the action is objective. Objective action
implies suitable and right behaviour in any situation
. It is impossible to prescribe how anyone
should behave in this or that situation. Every
situation involves a special and very complicated
set of circumstances, and no one can say beforehand
how they should be handled. The crucial questions
are :—Have the rules of community life been
mastered ? Is the individual ready to subordinate
himself to them ? If so, he will know more or less
the right course to adopt in any situation, no matter.
how difficult, because he will be able to regard his
problems objectively. He will never be baffled if
he can subordinate ego-centric wishes to the
objective needs of the community.
</p><p>
In spite of the apparent chaos of . present-day
social relationships we have rules to guide us.
These rules are clear to everyone even though they
have never been definitely formulated. Each
person becomes aware of the relentless logic of life
as soon as he tries to escape it. Success or failure
is the answer given by the community to fulfilment?
or non-fulfilment of the life tasks.
</p><p>
Frequently a man whose contacts with the
community are superficial appears to be consistently
 successful, while another who always seemed
to have adapted himself sufficiently to the needs
of the community may suddenly break down.
The explanation is that the strength of the community
 feeling is not always put to the proof. If
a man is spared by favourable circumstances from
undergoing rigorous tests, he may easily give others
the impression of being able to solve every problem.
He is like a pupil who for some time escapes
examinations. His knowledge is taken for granted.
If a man has to endure great hardships his lack of
training for life will be revealed more quickly. But
sooner or later everyone has to show how far his
community feeling has developed. This moment
decides whether his life cin be happy or not.
Therefore disdster and misfortune are not inevitable
causes of suffering and discouragement, but test
situations, which prove whether people are ready
to co-operate. While one accepts defeat, another
keeps a brave heart. He never loses his feeling of
comradeship with other people and in the end he
wins through.
</p><p>
Yet the community feeling does not mean, as
misrepresentations of the teachings of Alfred Adler
often incorrectly state, simply a feeling of belonging
to a certain group or class of people, or benevolence
towards the whole race. Sometimes the interests
of various groups conflict. (This is the dilemma of
a workman on strike, who may hesitate between
his family’s welfare and the need for solidarity
with his fellow workers.) In such perplexing
situations the community feeling causes us to see
that the interests of the super-ordinate group,
which are justified on the ground of  objective
needs, have the first claim on us. We certainly
want to do what we can to help men to found a
community embracing the whole human race, to
whose interests all the special interests of individuals
and groups would be subordinated. But in
practice we are still a long way from realizing this
ideal. The community feeling has no fixed
objective. Much more truly may it be said to
create an attitude to life, a desire to co-operate
with others in some way and to master the situations
 of life. Community feeling is the expression
of our capacity for give and take.

<p>
CLEARLY the attitude adopted by the individual
to the problems of community life could not
determine the development of his character were
he driven from the beginning in a certain direction
by inherited tendencies. If instincts and other
innate forces governed his behaviour at every
juncture, only a certain adaptation and modification
 of his personalty in response to the conditions
of his environment would be possible. It is found,
however, that all the characteristics of the individual,
 and indeed his whole personality, are
developed by the attitude he adopts to his environment
 in early childhood. Actually the personality
is developed in this way only if human soul-life is
teleologically orientated. In other words, the
object_which the individual pursues in his_actions"
is the decisive factor. We must admit this if we
believe that his attitude to his environment 
consistently determines all his actions, and the sum
of his actions—his personality.
</p><p>
But are we justified in rejecting causality, the
law which was hitherto thought to determine the
mental development of all human beings, in favour
of the view of finality, which prefers to stress the
fact that the individual can select from a great
variety of ways and means? We now find that
quite apart from psychology, science in general is
becoming concerned to an ever increasing degree
with this much debated problem—causality or
finality. '
</p><p>
Probably the Neo-Vitalists were the first to
assume that the question of use was the decisive
law governing all forms of life. They reached
their assumption after studying the evolution of
species and organs, and above all the biological
processes of the body. In their view all symptoms
of illness and all pathological changes are not
effects produced by some harmful agent, but
weapons for defeating it. The classical example
of this is inflammation, the "purpose" of which is
to destroy the invading bacteria by multiplying
leucocytes. Similarly every biological change is
understood solely in the light of the purpose it is
intended to accomplish.
</p><p>
Quite apart from such biological trains of thought,
Alfred Adler stresses the fact that all living things
move, and that every movement must have a goal.
So, according to Alder, all living things seek a goal.
With regard to man in particular, Alfred Adler
declares that it is impossible for us to understand
his behaviour-and actions unless we know their
goal.
</p><p>
This teleological mode of thought, which appears
to contradict all our accustomed beliefs, formerly
met with the keenest opposition from science, and
was frequently rejected as unscientific. The last
great development of the natural sciences in particular
 was based on acceptance of the doctrine of
causality, which regards every occurrence as the
simple effect of a certain cause. The theory that
a connection other than that between cause and
effect may be at the root of any observed occurrence
is extremely difficult to grasp, yet Individual
Psychologists are now experiencing the great
satisfaction of seeing it accepted by what is surely
one of the exactest sciences, Physics. Although
this repudiation of the law of causality made it
possible to ascertain the boundaries of causality
only in the realm of the smallest atom, it involved
such a fundamental change in the laws of thought
that the violence and frequency of the debates on
the subject among students of physics are understandable.
 This overthrow of causality in another
field at the same moment is an apparent coincidence,
 but has many parallels in the history of
the development of human thought, and there can
be no doubt that it contributed to the great advance
made in the field of psychological research.
</p><p>
When an individual acts in a certain way we
naturally ask why he does so. This indeed was
the only question asked by psychology before
Alfred Adler. In the early days of psychological
research people tried to find a purely mechanical
and material 'explanation for all actions. They
believed that impressions were transmitted to the
body through the sense organs, and then indirectly
—through a reflex or brain process —a certain
action was liberated. Freud was the first to
discard the theory that human actions are governed
by physical laws, and emphasized the need for
the acceptance and recognition of purely spiritual
laws for man, but even he was misled by the principlé
 of causality, and looked to the past for the
explanation of all human actions. He declared
that all former psychic experiences were reserves
of certain psychic energies, and therefore must be
recognized as compulsive factors, which necessarily
produce a certain result.
</p><p>
The principle of causality, whether it was handled
by materialists or by Freudians, was never particularly
 useful or practical. The subtler the methods
employed by the former in tracing the springs of
man’s actions, the more chaotic was the picture
in which they sought to reproduce multitudinous
sense irritations and reflex channels, and to prove
that man is governed by purely physical laws.
On the other hand, as a result of Freud’s attempt
to find a law of energy embodying his discovery that
man was dominated by a psychic force, rash
theories were advanced. These theories could
never be verified in practical life. They could only
be demonstrated in the special atmosphere of a
psycho-analyst’s consulting room. The next step
was to discover an entirely differenj law of movement
 for human beings.
</p><p>
Adler made a remarkable discovery when he
found the motive force of every human action in
the goal of the action. This discovery is fully
confirmed by personal experience, as far as the
normal life of a healthy human being is concerned.
Objections could only be raised with regard to some
human actions which appear to be useless and
senseless and to be performed against the agent’s
wish, or at least without his wish. Far from
rousing opposition, however, Adler’s views as.to
the purposive quality of even these aberrations
are supported by the observations of almost all
famous psychiatrists, including some who otherwise.
haye vlry little to say in favour of Individual
Psychology, such as Wagner-Jauregg, Bonhdffer,
Kahn, etc. It is true that they go only a little
way in accepting the teleological law. They do
not recognize the importance of the tendency
betrayed at the beginning of apparently unwilled
actions except in connection with outbreaks of
hysteria and neurosis which follow accidents. But
if they make only these exceptions, they admit
by implication that even when a man does not
consciously recognize the fact that his actions
have a certain goal—even when he feels that he
performs them against his own will—his actions
may still have a goal.
</p><p>
The phenomenon of the unconfessed goal is
closely connected with the problem of consciousness,
 which requires a more detailed discussion
than it can receive in this chapter. Here we will
limit ourselves to observing that it may not be
very obvious to an ordinary man that all his actions
have a goal ; so that a situation in which he feels
as if he is being driven first one way and then
another by conflicting wishes, and is not clear as
to what he really wants, may give him the impres-
sion that the human mind is the battlefield of
various instincts and impulses, and that the resulting
 action.is to be attributed to the victory of the
strongest instinct. Nevertheless, since we regard
the human being as an undivided personality, we
judge not only the resulting action, but also the
previous hesitation as a consistent and reasonable
"action," serving its particular purpose as effectively
 as a simple unfettered expression of will may
serve a different purpose. This subject will be
discussed at greater length in the chapter on the
unity of the personality.
</p><p>
It is obvious from everything that a human being
does that he has the power to orientate towards a
certain environment, for ultimately his action and
inaction are decided solely by the question of
“ which way ? " He is not driven through life by
his past, but impelled to go forward into the future
—and the force that impels him is not an external
force. He moves of his own accord. All his
actions, emotions, qualities and characteristics
serve the same purpose. They show him trying to
adapt himself to the community. CRaracter is ot
determined causally by equipment or instincts.
Neither is it formed by environment, which would
bring us back once more to causal determination.
Belief in finality is based on belief in the "creative
power" which enables a man to seek his goal as hef
judges best. Man acts far more than he reacts.
At this point Individual Psychology comes into
contact with the views of Bergson, who recognizes
the essential indetermination of every living
substance in his theory of the "élan vital."
</p>

<h2 id="SPOILT">
THE SPOILT CHILD
<a href="#CONTENTS">(UP)</a>
</h2>

<p>
FROM the very first day of his life the human child
has a place in a community with which he has to
make contact in order that the necessities of his
life may be satisfied. His first way of communicating
 with his surroundings is by screaming. He
cries for his mother to come when he feels hungry
or experiences any discomfort, and no matter how
small the infant, his screaming is regulated according
 to the parents’ behaviour.
</p><p>
From the very outset the infant has certain
social functions to perform. This makes some
kind of discipline essential. The infant’s first task
is feeding. It is comparatively easy to train a
healthy child to perform this task, that is to say,
to teach him to co-operate satisfactorily with the
mother. Every child will, of course, offer some
resistance to the first attempt to fix regular feeding
hours. He will scream at other times, but if the
parents are sensible and patient, they will not
allow this to deter them from enforcing their
system. The child will soon give up screaming,
and within a few days will automatically accustom
himself to regular feeding hours and even exhibit
a certain degree of satisfaction in keeping them.
So for the first time in his life he adapts himself and
co-operates with others as a member of the
community.
</p><p>
Unfortunately at this early stage serious mistakes
are very frequently made. From motives of false
pity over-anxious parents try to "spare the poor
little thing" in every possible way. "Oh, he'll
accustom himself to regular hours later on when
he’s stronger." It is very natural for the parents
of a child who is delicate or ill to feel extremely
concerned. By the doctor’s advice possibly even
these parents will attempt to teach a child regular
habits, but if the child has some difficulty in
learning to suck, and regularly loses strength
during the first days of his life, they will not have
the heart to ““let him go hungry " when he cries
to be fed. The result is that discipline is 
disregarded.
</p><p>
The older the child grows the more difficult it
becomes to teach him disciplified habits. Each
day strengthens his resistance to any change from
irregular hours, once he has grown accustomed to
them. At the same time the steady development
of his lung powers becomes more and more patent.
Then, as irregular hours prevent him from thriving
the mother’s anxiety increases. But the more she
tries to establish an orderly régime, the more the
child screams, and after a shorter or longer period
of hesitation the mother gives way. The. child
thus makes. l.1is first important discovery—that
he can get his own way by screaming, or at least
make his mother take him up and rock him in her
arms or give him something to pacify him.
(Freudians make the fatal mistake of regarding the
child and the whole of mankind as obedient to the
"pleasure principle", so that every frustration
must be the counterpart of a "pleasure ideal".
They forget that this applies only to people who
have not become happy members of the community.
Pleasure may be derived even from discipline, if it
appears reasonable, and after all, pleasure simply
expresses acceptance).
</p><p>
The result of the various forms of spoiling and
pampering is that the child grows up in a hot-house
atmosphere and enjoys artificial privileges, which
exempt him from the natural discipline of community
 life. He need not submit to the rules which
apply to all the other members of the first community
 he encounters in life—the family. Special
precautions prevent him from knowing any discomforts.
 Artificial warmth envelops him. He
need not earn recognition by any achievements
of his own. Pity and indulgence shield him from
all the disagreeable consequences of his actions—
He never learns to put up with anything he does
not like. Somebody is always ready to help him
and spare him the necessity of making any effort.
Over great anxiety holds him back from encountering
 dangers which spell risk and demand courage.
</p><p>
Parents who spoil a child make it very difficult
for the child to become a useful member of the
community. Most of us are spoilt children. This
is not the less true because many of us do not feel
at all as though we had ever been spoiled. For
every attempt to spare the child the necessity of
submitting to discipline must result in the child’s
disliking discipline, in his adopting a hostile
attitude towards it, and ever afterwards resenting
even the modicum of discipline which has to be
maintained wherever people live in a community.
(In this connection Freud speaks incorrectly of
the "destruction of instinct" which civilization
inevitably involves.
</p><p>
Whenever a child is spoilt a time always comes
when at last an attempt is made to discipline him.
The child naturally resists this. He cannot see
why something which he was hitherto allowed to
do should suddenly be forbidden once and for all.
He does not feel that order is a wise law, enabling
people to live together in a community, but a mere
parental whim. Frequently, therefore, all that
sticks in the memory of spoilt children is the struggle
with the parents, who for their part generally
make use of highly unsuitable methods to achieve
by force an object that could have been realized
‘without any difficulty at all, if they had previously
shown less weakness.
</p><p>
The only safe rule for ascertaining how much
spoiling a child has had and the degree of hostility
to discipline t.his has engendered is provided by
asking to what extent the child is aware of being
spoiled. A child is particularly alive to the
situation if, being the only child in the family, he
alone is pampered and allowed to dictate to the
other members of the family and regulate their
lives, as if they existed merely to minister to his
wants. He will not regard his pampered childhood
in the same light if later on he has to live in very
uncongenial surroundings. This alone shows that
the child himself is fully responsible for the meaning
he attaches to the parents’ behaviour, and for the
attitude to his past which he adopts in consequence.

SNUBBING

<p>
SOONER or later the spoilt child feels frustrated
and realizes that a right which he believes he is
justified in claiming is being curtailed. Spoiling
actually amounts to disregard of the child’s right
to become independent and to learn at an early
age what the requirements of life are. Usually
spoiling is far less the result of consideration for
the child, as the parents assert, than of consideration
 for their own feelings, because they cannot
bear seeing the child wear out his strength, suffer
in any way or get into difficulties. Doting
parents deprive the child of other vital rights.
These are the parents who cannot allow a young
child to sleep regular and sufficient hours, merely
because they want to dandle him, or because
visitors coming to the house want to admire him.
The desire to parade a child in front of visitors
encroaches on his right to play with other children.
Excessive anxiety deprives him of his right to
freedom of movement.
</p><p>
The child is frustrated and deprived of his rights
in a particularly flagrant manner if the parents
interfere with discipline and make disturbances
from no motives of love for the child, but solely
out of regard foy their own interests. If excessive
love often makes it difficult for the child to become
a happy and useful member of the community, as
much may certainly be said of unkindness, which
denies that the child has a place of his own in the
family. Children whose parents hate them because
they came into the world unwanted are often denied
their rights in a very shameful way. Sometimes
parents turn away from a child because she is a girl
instead of the boy they had been hoping to have,
or because they see a certain resemblance between
the child and some one they dislike. Sometimes
a parent has a spite against a stepchild. The
parents’ unkindness is always felt more keenly by
the child if he is very much indulged by another
person, who probably acts from some motive of
compensating justice.
</p><p>
Snubbing always arouses resistance. Often the
child’s resistance or obstinacy may appear to have
been destroyed by beatings or by other measures
of force adopted by his elders. But under cover
of even the most abject submissiveness the child
will still achieve his object—retreat from the 
community, evasion of all the implications of
communal life. Such is the effect produced on the
child if he thinks he is only hated. Not infrequently
 the child misjudges the parents’ behaviour.
He may believe that they care little for him, even
when this belief is not justified in reality. On the
other hand the child will not want to retreat into
himself if he fails to observe that his parents really
hate him, and remains unaware of being snubbed.
</p>

<h2 id="INFERIORITY">
THE INFERIORITY FEELING AND
STRIVING FOR SIGNIFICANCE
</h2>

<p>
WE have seen how both spoiling and snubbing may
hinder the child from becoming a useful member
of the community. We must now discover what
factor comes into play in the mind of the spoilt
child and the snubbed child alike. How can
experiences so different from each other as spoiling
or snubbing have the same effect—that of disturbing
 the community feeling innate in every
human being ?
</p><p>
When we examine this paradox more closely
we find that whether the child is spoilt or snubbed,
he always develops a feeling of his own relative
inferiority, which causes him to resist the rules of
the community and to adopt a hostile attitude
to the community. The behaviour of all children
and all adults establishes the general validity of
the following law : The natural community feeling
of every human being reaches its limits when feelings
 of inferiority arise.
</p><p>
A diagram may make the situation easier to
grasp.
</p><p>
The individual tries to get himself accepted by
the community (C). He therefore moves along the
line a—b, that is to say, if no obstacle checked his
advance towards the community he would move
along this straight line towards C. Man would only
act and develop in response to the conditions of his
community. The force ruling his actions and
psychic life would be undisturbed community
feeling.
</p><p>/// DIAGRAMME ///
</p><p>
But.we have seen that difficulties may prevent
the child from becoming a happy and useful member
of the community. He imagines that the com-
munity is a hostile world and feels unable to cope
with it. It seems to him that the community
repulses him and tries to force him down (in the
direction shown by the line b—c in our diagram).
</p><p>
In the minds of children, and later also of adults,
all ideas of being repulsed are inevitably connected
 with the subjective feeling of being " less
than other people. It is immaterial whether the
child accepts the superiority of others as a result
of spoiling, because he underestimates his own
strength and regards his dependence on the superior
strength of others as something to be taken for
granted, or whether as the result of snubbing he
has come to believe that the superior power of
others will always be victorious. Invariably the
child imagines that the contrast between his power
and the power of other people means that the
other people are "worth more" than he is.
</p><p>
The child resents this feeling of being low down
in the scale, and very soon all his actions show
that he is moving in a new direction. In response
to his innate community feeling he persists in trying
to get himself accepted at any cost by the community
. But as he assumes that his value is too
small or his strength inadequate, he thinks that
he can reach the community only by first climbing
to a higher position. Consequently, as already
stated, he moves in an entirely new. direction,
shown in our diagram by the line c—d. Any person
who labours under a sense of inferiority always
tries %o “obtain power of some kind in order to
cancel-the ‘Supposed superiority of other people.
His feeling of inferiority impels him to strive for
significance.
</p><p>
It should always be remembered that the inferiority 
feeling is a subjective feeling. The inferiority
may exist only in the imagination of the individual
when he compares himself with others. The
inferiority feeling is in a very deep sense quite
independent of a man’s true value, because when he
compares himself with other people he gives them
fictive values. 'Anyone who doubts his own value
always qver-es{imates the capacities of other
people. Therefore neither the absence nor the
presence of inferiority feelings is any index to a
man'’s real value. Some extremely valuable and
successful people suffer acutely from inferiority
feelings. On the other band we may not be able
to find a trace of an inferiority feeling in a lunatic.
An individual’s estimates of his own value, which
find expression in inferiority feelings, are based
entirely on his personal attitude to the community
and to other people. That is to say, they are
founded on his own opinions. He plays the réle
of both prosecutor and judge at his own tria.l.‘
The low value he assigns to himself often appears
to be connected with actual failures, but there can
be no doubt that anyone who believes that his
failures prove his lack of value deceives himself.
Very frequently people come to entirely wrong
conclusions about their own successes or failures.
Often a man disparages everything valuable that
he has done, and attaches far too much importance
to a completely senseless failure. oIn the end all
failures turn out to be not so much the causes of
inferiority feelings as inevitable consequences of
such feelings. As surely as people expect little of ]
themselves they meect with failures.
</p><p>
People betray their inferiority feelings and their -
consequent desire for significance in an endless
variety of ways. Wherever we observe human
mistakes and faults (which we only regard as
mistakes and faults because they violate the rules
which enable people to live in a community), we
shall always find a feeling of inferiority causing
the individual to renounce the direct line of
approach to the community. Every fault, whether
it is a defect of character, or a single instance of
mistaken conduct, grows out of evasion of some
social task. People evade social tasks in order tor’,
conceal their own deficiencies and to avert a',
dreaded failure.
</p><p>
There are two chief modes of evasion. On the
one hand people may run away from their oppor-
tunities, avoid making decisions, limit their sphere
of action and try to gain time or set a distance
between themselves and other people. We all
take out several of these "insurance policies "
during our lives. Our object is to conceal a feeling
of inferiority either from others or from ourselves.
On the other hand, people may try to deflect the
line they take in an upward direction. They try
to gain special significance by achievements in’
some particulay, field. If they can do so by means -
of useful ‘achievements they will perhaps appear
to be perfectly capable of adapting themselves to
the community, although their deepest impulses
were fear of the community and a tendency to
retreat. Sometimes, indeed, fear is the incentive
for outstanding achievements, which contribute
to human progress and the development of culture.
It is only when a man does not seek success in the
form of useful achievement, or undervalues con-
tributions he can make to the community because
his need for personal significance is too great, that
he acts in response to his will-to-power without
regard for anything useful and wastes his strength
“on the useless side of life."" He despises his
fellow-men, his environment and life itself, and
sets his heart on achieving meretricious’ successes
at any price, even at the price of his own suffering.
The martyr’s rdle of suffering is a particularly clear
example of the way in which a man appears to
reverse real circumstances in a struggle with a
powerful régime, since the helpless martyr triumphs
over the brute force of those who are actually
more powerful than he.
</p><p>
Disparagement of others and of life itself may
be expressed in a number of ways. Sometimes it
is displayed openly in dissatisfaction with every-
thing, or extremely cutting criticisms. Equally
often it poses as goodwill towards men. Extra-
vagant idealism or exaggerated moral tenets and
ethical principles set up such higl standards for
other people that they necessarily appear small
and worthless. Disparagement of reality is also
expressed in fantasy and melanpgoly:.and; most
frequently in daydreams, which relegate every-day-
life and the present moment entirely to the back-
ground.
</p><p>
These capacities for taking cover and finding a
fictive increase of power receive their training in
childhood. A spoilt child in particular quickly
succeeds in converting his feeling of inferiority into
a strong desire for significance. It is easy enough
for him to play a special réle, since he enjoys im-
portance by the mere fact of his existence, even
though he has no useful achievement to his credit.
He is most afraid of not being noticed, because he
thinks this means he is no longer important, He
claims every miinute of his mother’s attention.
He tries to stop her talking to grown-ups and other
children, and insists on her sitting with him while
he is going to sleep. But if he feels that he has not
sufficiently safeguarded his weak position, or
believes that it is being threatened in some way, he
adopts stronger measures. He behaves naughtily,
retreats into shyness, refuses to eat and gets into
tempers or panics. In brief, he employs all the
tricks of a cunning little animal in order to make
the grown-ups do what he wants them to do. The
spoilt child with an inferiority feeling always tries
to tyrannize in some way over other people,
especially if he happens to be an only child or the
youngest of a family.
</p><p>
So spoilt children develop various character-
istics, by means of which they try to overcome
their feeling that they have no value for other
people. The deficiency or supposed deficiency
they feel most keenly is their most vulnerable spot.
Often they are timid because they magnify dangers
and consequently try to give them a wide berth.
A child who feels that his own strength is inadequate
grows to need support. He tries to make other
people his slaves ; he lacks firmness of character ;
he becomes unruly and easily gets tired, with the
result that the grown-ups themselves have to carry
out his tasks if only for the sake of peace and quiet-
ness. Instead of finding happiness in successful
achievements, he looks for cheaper sources of
satisfaction ; he becomes frivolous, idle, and
pleasure-seeking, and escapes into fantasies and
daydreams.
</p><p>
A child who gets the impression that people
neglect and hate him tries to revenge himself for
his feeling of helpless frustration by giving them
as much trouble as he can. There is nothing very
attractive about the headstrong, grimy child who
knows just how to touch the grown-ups in their
weak spots and, of course, uses his knowledge to
protest against their treatment of him. He
behaves wilfully at school and becomes generally
unpopular with his teachers. His fondness for
giving the grown-ups unpleasant shgcks may even
encourage him to develop criminal tendencies,
for a perverse wish to be disagreeable is a common
motive for lying and stealing.
</p><p>
It would be necessary to quote individual case
histories in order to prove that all faulty behaviour
in childhood and adult life alike is the result of
unsuccessful attempts to overcome feelings of
inferiority in misguided ways. Yet we know that
the inferiority feeling is a driving force which
produces the most various travesties of asocial
conduct, because all impulses directed against the
community vanish in proportion as the inferiority
feeling diminishes and the individual learns to
estimate his own value more correctly. Once a
human being declares war on the community, 1
peace cannot be restored until he has found a
correct standard of values.
</p>

<h2 id="ORGAN">
ORGAN INFERIORITY
<a href="#CONTENTS">(UP)</a>
</h2>

<p>
ORGAN inferiority affords a particularly plain
example of the part played by inferiority feelings
and the way they may develop or be overcome. Any
organ or organ system in the human body may be
affected by an organ inferiority.
</p><p>
By organ inferiority is meant not an absolute
defect but a relative weakness of an organ as
compared with the functions of other organs, so
that subjectively the individual experiences difficulty in exercising his functions. Now, since the
use of functions constitutes the child’s principal
task in the community, anything which seems to
make it harder to regulate his functions also gives
him the impression of being worth less than other
people—that is to say, gives him a feeling of
inferiority. Some examples will probably make
this clearer.
</p><p>
An organ inferiority which affects the alimentary
tract does not in the least mean that the digestive
organs are unhealthy. It is true, however, that
if a child is delicate all the functions of the digestive
organs are more laboriously regulated and more
easily disturbed than they are in a healthy child.
It is more difficult to get the delicate child to eat
regular meals and he easily falls into irregular ways
with regard to defecation. He therefore finds it
more difficult to be an orderly member of the
community and to acquire habits of cleanliness.
All the child’s difficulties confirm his belief that it
is too hard for him to regulate the functions of the
digestive organs, though the other people who are
older have no difficulties of any kind.
</p><p>
All physical disturbances in the exercise of
functions can operate as organ inferiorities. A
child with eye trouble may grow up inattentive.
An inferiority of the uro-genital organs may lead
to difficulties in the control of the bladder function.
An extremely delicate constitution, which curtails
the length of time that can be spent in physical
exertions, or stoutness accompanied by ungainliness and clumsiness are resented and rated as organ
inferiorities. Similarly a child may resent being
unusually small—in fact, anything which gives.
him the impression that he is of less value physically
than other people.
</p><p>
Relative unskilfulness of the right hand in a
child who is born left-handed may also have the
effect of an organ inferiority. When this child
tries to learn to shake hands in the ordinary everyday way with the right hand, he will experience
considerable difficulty. He will then be inclined
to exaggerate his incapacity for learning to do
things correctly.
</p><p>
At this juncture a vital question presents itself
for consideration :—What is the outcome of organ
inferiority or what response does it evoke ? There
are two diametrically opposed ways of dealing
with this as with all other situations involving
psychological difficulties. The decision is simply
a question of more or less courage. Does the child
allow the difficulties resulting from an organ
inferiority to discourage him or not? On this
depends the course he subsequently takes. An
organ inferiority is never static. It is not something that merely exists. Rather it operates
dynamically through the final use to which it is put.
</p><p>
Let us consider in more detail the very common
organ inferiority of constitutional lefthandedness.
The child experiences difficulty in using his right
hand. The grown-ups find fault with him and
scold him. The child gradually loses faith in
himself and becomes careless and clumsy. When
he has to learn to write he writes badly. Nobody
realises that because he has been lefthanded from
birth he naturally finds it difficult to use his right
hand. He is always being reminded of his extra-
ordinary carelessness and clumsiness. If owing to
excessive spoiling the child has lost faith in his own
capacities at a very early age, he will regard every
difficulty which crops up as insurmountable and
give up trying to acquire manual dexterity because
he is clumsy with his right hand.
</p><p>
Among children who have becpme extremely
discouraged the organ inferiority of the right hand
may easily produce permanent defects in the exercise of important functions. These children will
always be clumsy. Their handwriting will be bad.
They will have hard work in making up their minds
to perform manual tasks and consequently they
will tend to become slovenly. As a result of being
lefthanded' (a peculiarity which is not always very
evident) a child may even have difficulty in learning
toread. So difficulties viewed in a spirit of growing
discouragement produce various defects.
</p><p>
The child may respond in this spirit to organ
inferiorities of the alimentary tract or of the
bladder. Great difficulty is experienced in regulating the functions of the digestive organs and
the child develops dirty habits. If he is severely
punished he will become bad-tempered. If his
parents show anxiety he will take advantage of his
difficulties to get more attention. In short, the
child will retreat further and further from a
courageous solution of his difficulties, and his
feeling of inferiority will grow in proportion.
</p><p>
But this is not the only way of responding to
an organ inferiority. If the child has not become
discouraged he treats his difficulty very differently.
He observes it and tries to overcome it. He
pounces most eagerly on his greatest difficulties
and tries to excel chiefly in activities in which these
difficulties seem calculated to hamper him. He
wants to mastes his difficulties and the requirements
of life at the same time. And success is within his
reach. Such a child later accomplishes outstanding
achievements in the very field where he at first
encountered difficulties. The early clumsiness of
lefthanded children gives place to special dexterity,
which, as often as not, finds expression in artistic
productions. Children with organ inferiorities of
the alimentary tract persevere in their efforts to
gain control and mastery of these functions until
they become extremely fastidious and methodical.
Frequently a special value attached both to eating
and defecation replaces the original difficulties.
</p><p>
These responses to difficulties all confirm a
fundamental law for overcoming inferiority feelings,
which was already stated by implication in the
previous chapter.<a href="#footnote2">[1]</a> Whenever an attempt is made
to compensate for an inferiority feeling, this is
never done by way of actual compensation, but
always in the sense of overcompensation.
</p>

<p id="footnote2">
<i>[1] Pages 27 and 29.</i>
</p>

<p>
The reason for this is clear. If anyone makes
great efforts so as not to be worth less than others
in a certain field he lives in constant dread lest he
should find that he is, and that other people will
know it also. And even when he has already
become as expert as other average people, he will
still be afraid lest there should be someone who
excels him. So he is continually drawn towards
the goal of perfection, which is never attainable
in practice.
</p><p>
Everyone who, instead of beigg discouraged,
tries to overcome organ inferiorities, obeys this law
of overcompensation. Very musical people are
often found in families where defects of hearing are
remarkably common, and artistic people in families
with all kinds of defects of eyesight. So we begin
to understand a fact which at first seems . very
perplexing—namely, that geniuses, artists’ and
great men often exhibit unmistakable signs of
organ inferiority in the very field of their outstanding achievements. Examples of famous
musicians whose hearing was impaired by constitutional organ inferiorities like Franz and Smetana,
famous orators whose speech organs were affected
by certain weaknesses in early life like Demosthenes
and Viktor Adler, famous painters with defective
eyesight like Manet and Lenbach, and famous
writers who combined a romantic imagination with
defects of eyesight like Karl May and Jules Verne,
can be multiplied at will and clearly prove that
frequently an__organ _inferiority.. provides the
incentive for artistic achievements. It is by no
means the only incentive for undertaking the special
training which necessarily precedes any outstanding
achievement. No doubt there are many reasons
why a child endeavours to achieve a special
success in a special field ; yet constitutional organ
- inferiority provides a stimulus which, far from being
rare, is extremely common.
The presence of a constitutional organ inferiority
cannot, however, be deduced from its consequences,
that is to say, from defects or from overcompen-
sation. It is justifiable to speak of an organ
inferiority only when it has been sufficiently proved
that there was a constitutional defect which
rendered the exercise of a function difficult. Proof
is furnished chiefly by the family anamnesia, i.e.,
when organic disorders of a certain organ system
occur extremely frequently among the nearest
relatives. Suspicion that an organ inferiority
exists may be confirmed by a number of other
indications, such as birthmarks, the development
of feverish skin disorders in that part of the body
which is nearest to the organ thought to be affected
by an inferiority, or by subsequent organic deteri-
oration of the organ ; for instance, by the appear-
ance of tumours, or by otosclerosis when organ
inferiority of the ear is suspected. There are
several signs that betray latent lefthandedness—
as for example, a steady preference for using the
left hand for performing small unimportant actions,
like clapping, cutting cards, etc.
</p><p>
On the other hand, we should not, of course, hold
an organ inferiority responsible for every difficulty
encountered in the use of a certain organ. It is
indeed true that as a human being develops, any
disturbances in the normal performance of functions
are most likely, ceteris paribus, to make common
cause with an organ inferiority. That is why
disturbances of functions are so, often used to
reinforce resistance or become modes of evasion.
</p><p>
A child can just as well use his organs (as, for
example, his digestive organs) to promote a dis-
turbance, even when they are entirely free from
organ inferiorities. The only safe guide is to see
whether by these means he achieves his object,
that is to say, whether other people and, above all,
his parents, submit to the disturbance. Any
healthy organ can be trained to promote a disturbance ; and under some circumstances even a
secondary functional disturbance, for which the
way has been prepared by sufficient training, may
later lead to relative overcompensation. For
example, children who hungerstrike without the
stimulus of organic defects may later attach
importance to eating plentiful meals.
</p><p>
This human tendency to overcompensate for
iinferiority feelings plays a most important part in
'the history of mankind. Just as an organ inferiority may lead to the performance of outstanding
artistic achievements in a particular field, so every
endeavour to rise higher, and every achievement
which promotes the development of the race and
advances civilization, is the outcome of the wish
to ease a gnawing feeling of inferiority. All
human beings experience moments of anxiety or
at least are troubled on account of the insufficiency
of the body, which is felt like an organ inferiority.
For the human body is not only little fitted to
endure the material hardships of life. It is also
subject to illness and death. Man knows the
cosmic laws of origin and dissolution. He perceives
his own smallness in the universe and is aware of
the anguish which is inherent in everything that
lives. Besides, as children we have all felt small
and inferior as compared with the grown-ups, and
we are all impelled to overcome difficulties.
Extreme physical defencelessness not only apparently caused men, as already noticed, to form
communities, but also led to the development of
the human intellect. In compensation for inadequate physical strength, man acquired the capacity
for using powerful forces outside his own person,
such as stones, weapons, animals, the forces of
nature and machinery.
</p><p>
In the life of an individual also the feeling of
inferiority may become the incentive for achievements which, while they help him to go forward
and develop more fully, also promote the advance
and higher development of the whole race. The
inferiority feeling ends in retreat and self-frustration
only when the individual has become so discouraged
that he no longer relies on achievements "on the
useful side of life."
</p>

<h2 id="HEREDITY">
HEREDITY AND EQUIPMENT
</h2>

<p>
THE observations concerning the importance of
organ inferiority in general and the implications
of overcompensation in particular which Alfred
Adler made when he began his investigations
formed the foundation on which the whole structure
of Individual Psychology was later erected, and at
the same time provided an entirely new standard
for rating the importance of hereditary equipment.
</p><p>
Laws of heredity come into force wherever life is
handed down from generation to generation and
there can be no doubt that they are applicable in a
very real sense to human beings. Man has from
birth many natural propensities, capacities and
weaknesses like any other animal, but he is funda-
mentally different from all other animals in that
the part played in his development by a community
life gives him a mastery over his "natural equipment" such as has never hitherto been observed
even among animals living in the closest of
communities.
</p><p>
The previous chapter dealt with the technique
of this mastery. Let us now look more closely at
the question of equipment.
</p><p>
It is obvious tAat if a certain function of the body
falls into disuse it becomes increasingly difficult to
exercise it. Any capacity may go to waste for
want of training in childhood. The most valuable
talent—amounting even to capacity for outstanding
artistic achievements—is useless to a child who
neglects and indeed probably refuses to train it
out of spite against his parents. The same applies
to a gift for mathematics or manual dexterity—in
fact, to any capacity for achievement in any field.
All human methods of achievement are extremely
complicated and cannot be mastered without
training. If training is neglected abilities remain
undeveloped. It is not even enough to have a
special talent.
</p><p>
Thus it becomes clear that what determines the
way in which the personality finally develops is
"not the equipment we bring with us, but the use
we make of it." <a href="#footnote3">[1]</a> By the interplay of neglect and
training each individual forms his capacities and
qualities as his individual position within the
community demands. He is free from the restrictions of causal determinism as represented by his
equipment.
</p>

<p id="footnote3">
<i>Alfred Adler</i>
</p>

<p>
Therefore what a man has become is in no way
_indicative of the quality of the equipment he had
at the outset. In every individual we see only the
phenotype, frorh which we can deduce little about
the genotype. With man we cannot as with other
animals learn much from the study of a series of
generations, not only because the aeries we are able
to observe are generally too short, but also because
in every separate case the significance of psychological phenomena can be understood only through
a course of psychological analysis which covers a
limited space of time, that is to say, only by
observing what is going on at the present moment,
and not by looking back to ancestors.
</p><p>
Scientific investigators find it easier to deal with
man’s physical inheritance. But it is necessary to
be cautious in discussing even this subject, as
processes which appear to be purely physical may
be changed in individual cases by psychological
factors. In most accounts of the connection
between physical structure and character the
physical factor generally, though not always, takes
precedence. Character and physical structure do
dndeed affect each other in turn, but a man’s
psychic personality, just as much as his innate
capacities and the physical conditions of his life,
represents material for him to utilize when choosing
his personal objective.
</p><p>
Man also exercises choice in his response to the
so-called “ instincts," which appear to govern him
like all living creatures. These are primarily the
instinct for self-preservation expressed by hunger,
and the instinct for continuing the race, expressed
by love. These inborn urges appear to dominate
all animals with the exception of those living in
very close communities, like ants, bees, men and
their domestic animals. Among these, as has
already been shown, numerous examples may be
observed of complete control gained over the urges
of hunger and love. So long as these and other
instincts are amenable to reason we have no ground
for assuming that our actions are arbitrarily
determined by our instincts. Only when our
actions are contrary to common sense do we appear
to have any argument for the alleged supremacy of
"instincts."
</p><p>
Upon closer examination, however, unreasonable
behaviour usually proves to be the “outcome of
hostility to the order established by the human
community, In themselves hunger and sexuality
are forces without direction. The individual
personality alone sets a goal before the "instincts"
and gives them a special content. Hunger then
becomes appetite and sexuality becomes love. All
the complications and conflicts involved in the
"satisfaction of the instincts" arise in this way.
The complications are not indications of the
strength of the ““ instincts "" but give expression to
individual proneness to create problems. Hunger
allows comparatively little scope for the attainment
of personal motives—thirst practically none. Hence
they can be more easily satisfied. But many
personal objectives may be concealed beneath love
and other instinctive emotions.
</p>

<h2 id="FAMILY">
THE FAMILY CONSTELLATION
</h2>

<p>
THE theory that each person has an innate individuality from birth appears to find confirmation in
the fact that children in the same family are
different from each other. It is indeed admitted
by those who uphold this theory that the parents’
behaviour can influence the child’s attitude, and
through this the development of his character, but
they say that the parents treat all the children alike
and that therefore the differences between the
children must be attributed to their equipment.
</p><p>
Upon closer examination, however, it is found
that each child has an essentially different position
in the family and must see all the circumstances of
his childhood in an entirely different light. Besides,
in practice the parents never treat two children
alike, but behave very differently to each. There
may be a difference in the affection they feel for
the children, and there certainly will be in the
opinions they hold about them. At this point it
might be useful to suggest briefly some points of
view which are characteristic of the different
children in a family.
</p><p>
Let us begin with the eldest child. The out-
standing fact of his childhood is that at first,
though only for a limited period, he was the only
child. While he is the only child he, is likely to
get far too much spoiling. He is the centre of
attraction and the special object of his parents’
care. Then he suddenly finds himself in the thick
of a tremendous experience. A brother or sister
is thrust upon him. Even if the first child is
already a few years old he is hardly ever able to
gauge the situation correctly. He notices only
that another child now continually monopolizes
his parents, especially his mother, who devotes
herself to him, and lavishes any amount of time
and care on him. He readily believes that the
newcomer will rob him of her love. He cannot
know, of course, that he was once looked after by
his mother in exactly the same way and that all the
care she bestows on the second child does not mean
that she loves him more. So, feeling that he has
been set aside, the eldest child frequently shows
understandable jealousy when another child is
born, even if before the birth of this child he longed
for a brother or sister
</p><p>
If the mother can make the elder child aware of
his undiminished value by pointing out to him his
importance as the elder and therefore more
advanced child, and so enlist his will to co-operate,
he will adapt himself to the new situation with
comparative ease. But the parents may not
understand what is going on in the elder child’s
mind and may grow impatient over his unfounded
jealousies and ailments. If, as is most probable,
they then take the younger child under their
protection in order to defend him against the elder
child’s overbearing conduct, the elder child may
easily give up trying to win good opinions by
making himself useful, as he probably could do,
but become obstinate and try to take up his
parents’ attention by resorting to every possible
trick that naughtiness can suggest to him.
</p><p>
Even if under the most favourable circumstances
two children of the same parents manage to live
together in apparent harmony they may become
involved in a rivalry which, though not always
openly declared is none the less deadly. The elder
child tries either to preserve his superiority or, if it
is already endangered at least to prevent the
younger child from attaining superiority. The
older the second child becomes and the greater the
part he takes in activities which formerly appeared
to be the prerogative of the elder child, the more
reasonable seems the latter’s fear of being overtaken
and surpassed. He endeavours in every way to
safeguard his superior position as the elder and
more advanced child.
</p><p>
‘What has been said about the first child suggests
the situation which the second child meets. He
never loses sight of the brother or sister who has
got a short start of him. He fully realizes that the
elder child is enqeavouring to impose his superiority
on him. He resents the imputation that he is less
important. He regards everything the other child
can do and he h.imsel(\ cannot do as an indication
of his own inferiority. | So every second child tries
to catch up to the first child. _This explains Why
second children are generally much more active
than first children, whether they choose the line
of useful achievement or naughtiness.
</p><p>
The outcome of the rivalry between the first and
second child depends mainly on the help each child
gets from others. The one who has the parents
on his side is, of course, in a stronger position.
Occasionally also an elder child, like Esau in the
Bible, may renounce his birthright because he
simply gives up trying to hold his position against
the attacks of the younger child. The child who
emerges victorious from the struggle is more likely
to be successful throughout the remainder of life
than the other, who will always accept defeat too
easily. The duel between the two first children
generally decides the whole subsequent course of
their lives.
</p><p>
As frequently observed, however, one child is
not always victorious in everything and the other
defeated in everything. One achieves superiority
in one province and the other in another. When
this happens we have the plainest proof that the
development of individual character is determined
even in the smallest detail by the attitude to
environment adopted in childhood.
</p><p>
It is not too much to say that we usually find a
fundamental difference both as regards nature and
character" bgtween the first two children. This
becomes easy to understand if we remember that
each of the two tries to achieve superiority in the
very field where the other encounters difficulties.
The younger child in particular develops an almost
uncanny power for detecting the elder child’s weak
points and proceeds to win praise from parents and
teachiers by achieving brilliant successes where the
other has failed. When there is keen rivalry and
only a slight disparity of ages between two children
of the same parents, we often find that later on at
school each does particularly well in subjects in
which the other does badly. If one child is puny
and ailing the other grows up robust and hardy.
If one is exceptionally clever at lessons the other
tries to win recognition by success in something
else. A child whose rival is very attractive in
appearance will probably try to impress people
with his intelligence or courage ; but obviously it
would be impossible to enumerate all the variations
produced by this preference for antithesis. '™ "
</p><p>
The antithesis often seems to be based on
inherited capacities, especially if each of the
children appears to take after a different parent.
But a child’s psychological attitude can make the
physical likeness to one parent more pronounced.
A certain similarity may result from imitation of
this parent’s fagial expressions, gestures, attitudes
and peculiarities of speech; for a characteristic
cast of features is gradually formed by constant
repetition of the same facial movemepts.
</p><p>
To a far greater extent, however, similarity of
nature and character is the outcome of the child’s
special training. It is true that we cannot tell
beforehand why the child should imitate this
particular parent. We can only be wise after the
event. Often the child tries to acquire the charac-
teristics of the parent whose ally in family quarrels
he has become. He seizes on these characteristics
because he hopes to reach the goal of superiority
by evincing like the parent who is his ally a definite
character as against the other members of the
family. Actuated by the same desire to gain
power, many children imitate the parent with whom
they are in direct conflict.
</p><p>
Freud fully recognizes the importance of this
situation for the formation of a child’s character.
But while in his eyes it is indicative of a very
complicated development of the Ego-ideal, which
makes the feared and hated parent a secret object
of love, Individual Psychology has a very simple
explanation to offer. The parent who counters
many wishes and is very severe is the child’s
conception of power. This explains why children
imitate the parent they fear. They merely wish
to have this parent’s power. So we are able to
formulate the only fundamental law governing the
development of the child’s charagter: he trains
those qualities by which he hopes to achieve independence or even a degree of power and superiority in the family constgllation. .
</p><p>
In a large family of children the conflict between
the first and second child is repeated under some
form or other lower down in the family, but it
generally tends to be less fierce. Consequently
children who come in the middle of a family usually
develop more balanced characters. The third
child frequently sides with one of the two elder
children. Often two children lower down in the
family treat each other as rivals like the first and
second children.
</p><p>
The youngest child has a special rdle to play.
Not merely one child, but all the other children are
ahead of him. All the other members of the family
spoil him and regard him as the little one. He
generally develops characteristics which make it
likely that other people will help him to shape his
life, such as helplessness, a winning nature and
whimsicality. But youngest children often prove/:
very clever if their smalluess becomes an impulse{
for outstanding achievements.
</p><p>
A boy in a family of girls and vice-versa one girl
in a family of boys is in a special position. These
children will form a characteristic appreciation of
their roles and will develop qualities which help
them to play these roles. They often overestimate the importance of the réle of their own
sex, because this represents the esgential difference
between themselves and all the other children.
Naturally the importance they attach to the rdle
played by their own sex also depends,on the value
attached to it within the whole family and above
all on the value attached by the parents to their
own sex rdles, with the possible superiority of either
the father or the mother.
</p><p>
So it becomes understandable why people adopt
a certain attitude to their fellow beings in child-
hood, and why above all they get a definite idea
of themselves. We must now try to see why a line
of conduct' which was reasonable and under-
standable in childhood is pursued throughout the
rest of life.
</p><p>
[54]
</p><p>
THE LIFE PLAN AND THE LIFE STYLE
JAT birth the child encounters an unknown world
</p><p>
{:nd a mode of life which he has to learn. Above
all he has to learn the rules of the human com-
munity, to per,fon}x functions and master the
tasks set by life. /At first the child sees only that
part of life and of the human community which is
bounded by his environment, the family in which
he is living. To him this environment means
“life " and the members of the family seem to be
</p><p>
* ‘“the human community " and he attempts to
adapt himself to them.,
</p><p>
He seeks to maintain himself within this concrete
community by means of a variety of acquired
accomplishments, characteristics, modes of behav-
iour, capacities and artifices. The difficulties he
encounters have been outlined in previous chapters.
If we now examine the situation more closely we
</p><p>
. find that the child is bound to get the impression
. that the difficulties he personally experiences are
" the absolute difficulties of life. He does not realize
" that the other people round about him are involyed
in conflicts of an entirely different nature. (His'
growing intelligence prompts him to overcome the
difficulties of hi¢ position, so far as this appears
possible, unaided and alone..
[55]
</p><p>
THE LIFE PLAN
</p><p>
This explains why every individual by the time
he is four to six years old has developed a definite
character  and) why &ny fundamental change of
character gfter the fourth to sixth year is hardly
possible) ?Character is)therefore imply the mani-
festation of a certain plan which the child has
evolved and to which he will adhere throughout
the rest of his life.
</p><p>
A child’s life plan does not grow out of a certain
peculiarity nor out of isolated experiences, but out
of the constant repetition of certain difficulties,
real or imagined, which he encounters. Each
individual will find out special ways and means
which appear to be serviceable for his special plan.
Out of the individual’s special life plan develops
the life style which characterizes him and every-
thing he does. His thoughts, actions and wishes
seize upon definite symbols and conform to definite
patterns. The life style is comparable to a
characteristic refrain in a piece of music. It brings
the rhythm of recurrence into our lives. Everyone
offers the stoutest opposition to any attempt that
is made for whatever reason to change his life
style. '
</p><p>
So we can understand why an only child becomes
timid if he feels that to be alone and unaided is the
greatest hardship in life—a difficulty which cannot
be surmounted, and why he betrays himself at
every turn if he rates his importance in the com-
munity in terms of the recognition and consideration
</p><p>
(561
</p><p>
THE LIFE STYLE
</p><p>
he gets. We can understand why the eldest child
of a family may live in constant dread of being
supplanted 4nd why a second child may always
feel at a disadvantage. It also becomes clearer
why in later life these people continue to behave
as though they were still living in the same situation
as in childhood.
</p><p>
In addition to the difficulties encountered within
the family circle, the child’s social environment
.plays an important part in fixing the life plan.
The family’s position in the community may cause
the child to conclude that community life involves
certain social and economic dangers. Social con-
ditions may determine the ideas he forms about
his position in relation to his comrades and play-
mates—in short, in relation to all his fellow beings.
In order to contend with all these dangers he tries
to evolve a definite plan.
- An imaginary example may make the situation
plainer. Let us picture a child growing up in a
colony of thieves. He learns that if he is to
maintain himself at all he must keep a careful
watch on his property, distrust others and defend
himself against their depredatory tendencies.
Later on he is able to leave the colony and live in
the ordinary world where thieves do not compose
the entire population. But he continues to behave
as before, because his chief fear in life is to become
‘the victim of g thief. He does not believe the
assurances other people give him that this fear is
</p><p>
[s71 E
</p><p>
THE LIFE PLAN
</p><p>
excessive, and is always looking out for incidents
which appear to justify his behaviour. Whenever
anything is stolen he feels triumphant." If on the
other hand he hears of an honest finder who has
given up his find, he is inclined to dismiss the report
as untrue and say that he is not simpleton enough
to believe such a fantastic story. And if sooner
or later it becomes impossible for him to doubt a
person’s honesty, he gets out of his dilemma in
another way. This man, he says, must certainly
be crazy—at least, he is different from normal
people.
</p><p>
Probably, however, his companions will appeal
to his better nature and tell him that he really must
give up his unreasonable mistrust. He may then
try to prove that he is broadminded and actually
give his confidence to some person; but it is
practically certain that the first person he trusts
will turn out a thief—partly because people of this
type have been familiar to him from childhood and
he feels secretly at home with them, and partly
because he can turn the incident to account as an
irrefutable argument : " There now, you see what
happens if I believe what you say ! After this
he can continue to practise without let or hindrance
the rules of conduct he learnt as a child and hold
the wickedness of other people responsible for all
the disagreeable experiences he goes through in
consequence. .
</p><p>
This obviously imaginary example of a single

peculiar circumstance exaggerated out of all pro-
portion to the real conditions of life illustrates
firstly the indportance of the life plan. Secondly
it shows that it is possible to persist in the course
first chosen only by grossly misrepresenting facts
encountered later. We are forced to regard every-
thing we see and all our experiences from a biased
standpoint if we wish to preserve intact the
mistaken ideas about life and ourselves which we
formed as children. The private brand of logic
which each person evolves appears to justify his
mistaken behaviour, and prevents him from seeing
that most of the difficulties and disappointments
in his life are the jogical consequences of mistakes
in his life plan.’
[s591]
</p><p>
THE FICTIVE GOALS—
</p><p>
THE MASCULINE PROTEST?
As we have seen, what most often endangers the
success of the individual’s attempts to fit into the
community and his hope of living a sane and happy
life is the feeling of his own inferiority. So each
human being’s chief problem is the problem of his
own value. As long as his value remains un-
challenged he is in no danger of creating problems
for himself—not even when he encounters external
difficulties which do not involve psychological
problems but mos} often provide a stimulus for
consistent effort.: ° -
</p><p>
Uncertain people who come into sharp conflict
with their surroundings, including neurotics of all
kinds, have the greatest difficulty in solving this
problem of their own value. But no human being
is entirely free from neurosis, least of all the modern
city dweller, since the first human community he
knew was most probably the disintegrating family
of the present day.
</p><p>
In obedience to the human law of overcompen-
sation, every human being’s life is directed towards
"the goal of increased personal importance. As the
</p><p>

many of Alfred Adler’s own statements and quoted largely from
his writings.
</p><p>

</p><p>
THE MASCULINE PROTEST
individual, while remaining unconscious that he has
set this goal before himself, nevertheless gives a bias
to his whole life and to all his actions in his endeav-
our to reach it, this fictive goal is the key to the
riddle of his whole personality. The stronger his
feeling of inferiority the more complicated his
behaviour becomes.
</p><p>
The child who has a constitutional inferiority—
we may include the ugly child, the pampered child
and the child who has been brought up too strictly
in the same group—will make great efforts to escape
the many hardships®of his life and to ward off the
danger of a defeat which seems to threaten at some
distant future date. He feels that he needs a
landmark to keep in view because he has no seﬁe .
of direction. So he has recourse to a helpful
fiction. He regards himself as unskilful, inferior,
subordinated and uncertain in judgment. He finds
a guiding line which becomes the normal line
followed by his thoughts and actions when he takes
as his second fixed point his father or mother, whom
he endows in imagination with all the power in the
world. He then tries to rise above his uncertainty
to the supposed security of his all-powerful father,
and even surpass him.
</p><p>
All feelings of uncertainty and inferiority give
rise to a need for an objective to guide, reassure and
make life bearable. The result is the crystallizationi
and hardening eof every characteristic which repre-
sents a guiding line in the chaos of life and so lessens
</p><p>
[6x]
</p><p>
THE FICTIVE GOALS
uncertainty. In the many complications and
perplexities of life the guiding lines are intended to
divide right from wrong and above from below.
</p><p>
In the eyes of the child brought up in the modern
civilized world the concepts masculine and feminine
are just such a pair of contraries corresponding to
above and below. - Our civilization is mainly a
masculine civilization, and the child gets the
impression that while all adults enjoy superior
powers th¢ man’s position is superior to the
woman’s. :Although she occasionally manages to
encroach on his privileges, he still appears to be
more powerful, more important and more fortunate.
He has greater physical strength; he has the
advantage in height ; he has a more powerful voice.
(As soon as the child is able to appreciate the
numerous social privileges enjoyed by men he may
easily come to regard the male as the symbol of
power," His concept of masculine will include
whatever is “ above " and his concept of feminine
whatever is “ below". The woman’s réle seems
to be one of service and longsuffering. The boy’s
goal of superiority prompts the resolve: ““‘I'm
going to be a real man." From this standpoint he
protests against any treatment which seems likely
to lower his value. So the “ masculine protest
may become the main fiction of his whole
personality.
</p><p>
We find that women also haves masculine goals
if they are unwilling to accept their sex role. Some
</p><p>
[62]
</p><p>
THE MASCULINE PROTEST
who desire only power or knowledge modify the
masculine ,ideal. In fact, most people have a
masculine goal or an equivalent of a masculine
goal.
</p><p>
The masculine goal is, of course, only a fiction
which determines what is “ above" and what
‘“ below "’, and enables the individual to select a
guiding line. Every child creates many pairs of
contrary concepts of ‘“ above " and " below ", as
his own experiences in life suggest. Even normal
children want to be tall and strong and take
command in something—" like father,"—and this
final goal influences their behaviour. Any child
who feels small and helpless may accept the guiding
fiction that he should behave as if his rdle, was to
be superior to everybody. R
</p><p>
The neurotic is not alone in trying to make his
life conform to fictions which increase his sense of
personal importance. The healthy person also
would have to give up all hope of orientation in the
world if he did not try to make his picture of the
world and his experiences conform to fictions.
These fictions assume very definite shape in times
of uncertainty, and find expression in the indi-
vidual’s opinions, beliefs and ideals.
</p><p>
The fiction of a final goal of power attracts all
human beings, especially people who feel uncertain
of themselves, such as neurotics. The influence
of this fictive goal is enormous. It draws all psychic
forces in its direction.
</p><p>
{63]
</p><p>
THE FICTIVE GOALS
</p><p>
A human being’s fictive goals and the guiding
lines by which he hopes to reach his goals remain
unchanged throughout his life as long as they are
not disclosed by unusually penetrating self know-
ledge. That he must have if he is to change them.
A human being’s character is the outcome of his
life plan, fictive goals and guiding lines. Passions
and ‘instincts " are exaggerated characteristics:
An apparently spontaneous change of character
may occasionally be observed, but if it was not
due to the exercise of an unusual degree of insight,
or to external influences, such as a change of
environment, it generally proves to have been
superficial. The most cherished goals were not
abandoned. Consequently the fundamental nature
of the personality remained unaffected. The
change was merely a change in the choice of means.
</p><p>
[64]
</p><p>
CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIENCE
THE ordinary man has very little idea of how his
own mind works. He does not know that all his
actions betray a bias although this is plain to an
onlooker. We are thus brought face to face with -
a remarkable fact:—that it is possible for an,
individual to have * unconscious’ tendencies,:
inclinations and motives.
</p><p>
The modern craze for psycho-analysis has so
popularized the word ““ unconscious " that every
one now uses it without realizing what complicated
</p><p>
roblems the concept involves.
f éonsciousness is a faculty of the mind that is
comparatively easy to understand. Man has the
capacity for *“ knowing ’ much of what goes on in
his mind. Apparently this knowledge, which we
call * consciousness "’, is connected with functions
performed by certain parts of the brain) But not
only has it been pointed out that these parts of the
brain represent nothing more than a disappearing
portion of the whole, an observation which in itself
does not take us far, as it seems probable that large
sections of the human brain fulfil no functions ; it
has also been ascertained that the functions fulfilled
in the centres o$ consciousness constitute only an
insignificant part of all the activities of the human
[65]
</p><p>
CONSCIOUSNESSJAND CONSCIENCE
brain. That is to say,(g‘:onsciousness is only one
of the many functions of the human pra.in? At the
same time we have every reason to believe that[g;ir
capacity for conscious thought develops with the
development of speech. There is a close connection
between language and conscious thought, for
conscious thought is always symbolic thought. We
can hardly concei,}re of consciousness without
symbols or words.) L
</p><p>
What on the other hand is the unconscious ?
Shall we be right in applying the term * uncon-
scious " to everything that goes on in the human
brain beyond the grasp of consciousness ? Hardly ;
for as a rulefour consciousness is able to hold only
one or at the most a few thoughts, while our brain
fulfils a great variety of functions. Countless
impressions reaching our sense organs set in motion
reflex processes and many activities follow gauto-
matically without any thought on our part) _l
</p><p>
‘We had to learn many every-day accomplish-
ments before we became expert in them. There
is no doubt that skill in these accomplishments,
whether they involve physical movements or
intellectual activities, was acquired only by the
exercise of particularly keen powers of observation,
which were, in fact, cortical in origin. As training
in a brain process goes on, a centre is fixed for the
whole co-ordinated complex, which gradually
becomes embedded in the sub-costical.
</p><p>
Walking, for instance, involves countless mus-
</p><p>
[66]
</p><p>
CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIENCE
cular movements, which we no longer have to
control, because they merge into each other and
form a unit. So walking is an acquired accom-
plishment which we can use at will. When we are
learning a language we try to master and under-
stand single words, learn phrases and repeat
sounds. We then have a certain vocabulary, we
can express ourselves, we can pronounce words
and we have gained powers which we exercise
automatically when we wish to use the language.
Is it reasonable to include all these brain processes,
which are performed without our consciousness, in
the term * unconscious " ?
</p><p>
Before attempting to answer this question we
will examine the meaning given to this word
“‘ unconscious "’ by popular usage. People do not,
of course, use the term " unconscious "’ to describe
everything of which they know mnothing, but they
talk of having done certain definite things uncon-
sciously. In fact, ever since the word was
popularized—chiefly by Freud—people have talked
about * the unconscious "’ when they might have
expressed what they meant more simply by
saying, ‘' I ought to have known this, but actually
I knew nothing about it." They therefore use the
word ““ unconscious "’ to describe any psychological
or mental process which, as experience shows,
normally comes within the grasp of their con-
sciousness, butsin this special instance is hidden
from their knowledge.
</p><p>
(671
</p><p>
- CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIENCE
</p><p>
So the quality of ““ the unconscious " character-
izes above all inclinations and tendencies which
are not known to us. In everyday life we are
aware of the part played by our consciousness chiefly
in making plans and in carrying out our wishgy.
</p><p>
(Conscious thought prepares the way for actionf
</p><p>
Nevertheless, modern psychological research
shows that even in preparing the way for action
consciousness does not play such a decisive part as
was formerly supposed. The behaviour of the
smallest child is a study in discrimination. He
knows what he wants, realizes what the conse-
quences of certain kinds of behaviour will be and
correctly gauges situations which are often very
complicated—all this at an age which certainly
excludes the possibility of his having any con-
sciousness in our sense of the word, that is, power
to think symbolically, for he may still be in his
infancy.
</p><p>
Nor can we very well speak of " unconscious "
processes where consciousness has not yet devel-
oped. We must have this contrast between " the
conscious "’ and " the unconscious "’ before we can
form an idea of either. It is unreasonable to
suppose that * the unconscious"’ can exist where
consciousness is lacking. (Consciousness dawns
only with twvelopment of a thinking, knowing
personality) d now we come to the point where
we must ask how an apparent cleavage of conscious-
ness originated.
</p><p>
[es8]
</p><p>
CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIENCE
</p><p>
We bhave seen how the child’s personality is
developed by the part he plays in the human
community, {how he may encounter difficulties
when he tries*to get himself accepted as a member
of the community and how he may fail to respond
in a positive way to his environment. Many of
his actions are stratagems which he employs in a
struggle against his environment. The child’s
guardians generally fail to understand most of these
stratagems. They do not trace them back to their
real causes, but think that they indicate faults for
which the child is to be held blameworthy. The
guardians’ influence is generally limited to impress-
ing on the child the fact that his behaviour is wrong
without helping him to change his attitude. As
long as the child rejects the guardians’ principles
he is free to rebel against them. His obstinate
and defiant behaviour is entirely consistent. The
grown-ups, however, have so much power that the
child dare not resist them openly. He therefore
has to behave as if he means to obey his guardians,
especially if he wants their help. This is when
conscience begins to develop. Conscience implies
more and no less than acceptance of the rules
</p><p>
d principles represented by the guardians.
All children know perfectly well what is expected
Bt them and what the established rules are. Most
children accept these rules if only as a matter of
form because it i3 too dangerous and difficult to defy
them) For open defiance the child substitutes a
</p><p>
[691]
</p><p>
CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIENCE
struggle within himself and in this the guardians
generally encourage him because they hope that
exercise of “ self control" will lead }o the final
victory of ‘“good" in the child. NAturally this
type of upbringing is never successful. The child’s
hostile and negative impulses are unchanged, even
though they may be concealed beneath an appear-
ance of good intentions.
</p><p>
This situation, which arises in childhood, changes
very little during the remainder of the individual’s
life. At first conscience represents only the
guardians’ wishes. Later it seems to personify
law and order in the community. {Conscience
indicates awareness of the claims of the communit»az
and in so far as the individual is the product of
‘“good " education his conscience accepts these
claims. But whenever he obeys motives which
reveal hostility to the community and a desire for
personal superiority he becomes involved in a
conflict with himself. Every part of his ego which
represents the standpoint of general morals appears
to range itself against actions instigated by asocial
tendencies. At this moment when he appears to
have renounced singleness of purpose and has to
choose between two incompatible objectives he
takes the same line of conduct which he adopted
with success when he ranged himself as a child
against his guardians. He makes excuses.
</p><p>
At first excuses were intended, to pacify the
guardians and ward off or mitigate punishment.
</p><p>
[70]
</p><p>
CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONSCIENCE
After the education of the conscience had pro-
ceeded further and the individual had himself
become convil-.‘:ed of the justice of the rules he
had been taugllt he found it necessary to excuse
himself before hiS own conscience. His best way
to do this is simply to repudiate responsibility for
his own evil and unnatural inclinations—in fact,
to know nothing about them. So the unconscious
is created.
</p><p>
&rhe unconscious embraces all emotions, wishes
and inclinazt)ns for which people will hot be
responsible) & which they will not admit they have,
in order to evade responsibility. It is not limited,
as Freud thinks, to " suppression" of sexual
emotions. In the early days of Psycho-Analysis
the sexual life perhaps appeared to be hedged about
with special prohibitions. Nowadays people are
far less unwilling to acknowledge their sexual
desires than to recognize their own responsibility
and the extent to which they arrange their own
lives. The * unconscious " is not by any means

THE UNITY ®F THE PERSONALITY
PRACTICALLY everyone divides the ego into two
parts, ranging “ I must ’’ against ‘I ought not "
and emphasizing the contrast between I will "
and “I cannot". Invariably this contrast is
created by self-deception. It is the excuse of a
man who wants to absolve himself from responsi-
bility, whether in the eyes of others or in his own
eyes, for a certain action or a certain line of conduct.
His purpose in having an inward conflict at all is
to exculpate himself and make it seem that while
he means well his own weakness, due either to
constitutional defects or inherited faults of char-
acter, prevents him from carrying out his good
intentions. In reality the united personality with
its consistent purposiveness underlies and tran-
scends all apparent contradictions.
</p><p>
The doctrine of the unity of the personality gave
Individual Psychology its name. This name, which
is so often misunderstood, is derived from the
Latin word “ individuum," which literally means
“ undivided," *‘indivisible" (in-dividere). "In-
dividual variety "’ is the outcome of the life style,
which varies with every single jndividual and is
characteristic of him alone. His life style is based
</p><p>
[72]
</p><p>

on consistent purposiveness, which assigns a special
place in the whole plan to every one of his actions.

ourselves and others form part of a consistent mode
of behaviour.
</p><p>
(@nconsistencies and bipolarity invariably charac-
terize the thoughts and actions of a person who
has n(Zintention of proceeding openly towards his
goal,) €The possibility of reaching the same goal
by following diametrically opposed lines of conduct
accounts for the bewildering changes he makes in
his behaviour in order to evade tasks and conceal
his irresponsible tendencies.
</p><p>
Whether the child is defiant or obedient his
object is the same-—to assert the value and import-
ance of his personality and to win an advantage
over the grown-ups. His defiance gives the grown-
ups a direct proof of their helplessness. His
obedience makes use of them and compels them
to help him.

A traveller going along a country road

gives him information about the roads which lie
ahead, short cuts he could take and the best inns
to stop at. Meanwhile the other tramp uses the
opportunity to pilfer something from the traveller's

theft he will not fail to realize that the two tramps
were accomplices, in spite of the apparent difference
in their behaviour.

issues are involved, these conflicts provide oppor-
tunities for making romantic gestures, for often
people who ‘pave deserted from the firing line of
life fly to a niigor seat of war, where they content
themselves with false glory won in battles which
are more spectacular than serious. *A" man who
is skilful in arranging conflicts with his feelings

he may have no reason for being extraordinarily
proud of winning victories over his own feelings.
For instance he shows no particular merit in not
indulging in certain luxuries if he has other more
urgent calls on his purse. But how much nobler
he seems to himself if he has to struggle for a long
time with his irrepressible longing for luxuries

</p><p>
Bo every contradiction in rdividual purposive-
ness proves to be deceptives { In order to discover
the object pursued by a certain individual on a
certain occasion it is, of course, necessary to know
his special circumstances and above all to have an
insight into his personality. The same actions and
the same conflicts may involve very different issues
for different people. Jdeas, wishes and emotions
throw far less light on the personality than actionsy

Under certain circumstances we may indeed
consider that thoughts and feelings have the value
of actions. On the other hand thoughts, feelings
and above all wishes very often cogﬂédict what is
actually done. \Actions are the ogiy safe guide for
understanding the personalit%lwhich so often
turns towards fictive goals: e must make up
our minds to regard everything else as mere

</p><p>
Power to appreciate the signiﬁ'EEnce of actions
not only helps us to build up a technique for
studying human nature. It is most valuable in
connection with self-education. Particularly in
our own lives we find that apparent contradictions
in our thoughts, emotions and wishes, occupy the
foreground of our consciousness, so that we forget
to judge our actions. Fhe reason why seli-
knowledge is so difficult to acquire is that for the
sake of maintaining an ethical personality we try
to hide any of our impujses which are hostile to
society from ourselves.,ﬁurther, wtue self-know-
ledge would bring us disconcerting revelations(z
Our own fictive goals would be disclosed. We
should see that they were mistaken goals and they
would have to be given up. But an apparent
splitting of the personality makes it possible for us
to reconcile the real claims of environment with
the imaginary claims of will-to-pawer.
</p><p>
[76]
</p><p>
NEUROSIS
</p><p>
“PHE lives of neurotics are ful'“;)lf contradictions
between wishes and actionsy erever we find
neuroses we find that these cohitradictions appear
to be based on the idea of illness. A human being’s
free control over himself and his actions and his
powers of endurance appear to be as much restrjcted
by a nervous illness as by a physical injury«? Yet
no direct physical correlation corresponds to the
</p><p>
" mervous symptoms. In fact, the organism is
healthy. Any somatic changes which can be
traced objectively are limited to the vegetative
system. This, however, is nothing more than an
apparatus for regulating physical functions, which
can also be controlled by the mind. All the
physical symptgms of neurosis are created by
mental tension,zFurther, any pathological changes
in the vegetative system can be explained in the
same way.
</p><p>
We cannot disregard the fact that in the neurotic
we have a healthy man who gives the impression
of being ill and undeniably exhibits symptoms of
illness, with the result that it is not always easy in
making a diagnosis to distinguish between a
“ merely " nerveus and a “real " illness.
</p><p>
Here we have yet another example of man’s
</p><p>
= {771
</p><p>
. NEUROSIS
capacity for deceiving himself and others by
constructing false analogies. We have seen how
he dissociates himself from his own will as soon as a
contradiction between his wishey and actions
appears to offer some advantage. g\Teurotic illness
draws an analogy between itself and physical pain,
which really does restrict physical functions quite
independently of the will. So the neurotic (though,
of course, without admitting it) uses his unimpaired
will power to reproduce symptoms of illness which
enable him to feel that his command over his will
is restricted just as it would undoubtedly be by a
physical illness.
</p><p>
The problem—how to arrange an illness ““ uncon-
sciously ", that is to say, without admitting that
it is arranged—was simplified chiefly by the
teachings of Beard. These teachings, which were
widely studied by experts and laymen, put forward
the hypothesis of a nerve force said to be subject to
disturbances. Beard sought to find some physical
explanation for all symptoms gowadays described
as nervous and called them illnesses of the nervous
system or of ‘ the nerves." But the existence of
this hypothetical “ nerve force " (which was said
to be easily exhausted by overwork, excitement,
sexual perversions and the strain felt by people who
suffer from inherent weaknesses, with the result
that nervous ailments or neurasthenia developed)
could never be proved objectively. The limits of
endurance could only be discovered subjectively
</p><p>
Lol81
</p><p>
. NEUROSIS
by each person for himself. So whenever an
individual evaded tasks, his evasion was regarded
as a form of illness which had developed because his
nerve force was not sufficiently strong to bear the
strain he put on%t. These teachings so popularized
the " contradiction "’ between what people can do
and what they want to do, that anyone can now
make use of the idea whenever it suits him. In
fact, all that is needed once people have accepted
this idea is that it should be possible for them to
“learn " symptoms of illness. So a medical
hypothesis, which otherwise would never have been
taken seriously, rapidly won general acceptance in
spite of its improbability.
~There is always a de‘?nite moment when a
nervous illness begins.»/(= his indicates that the
individual is confronted With tasks which he does
not feel able to perform, but the fact is not always
very obvious, because the neurotic naturally tries
to make out that the difficulties he encounters in
life are the consequences and not the causes of his
illness. Many neurotics even deny the existence
of the difficulties they have, because they want to
avoid the suspicion that their nervous symptoms
serve a purpose. aAs most of us are ill prepared to
perform the tasks of life, we easily become “ nervyi/}
Even a child has to bear special burdens and may
develop “nervosity". This frequently finds ex-
pression in thesso-called impossible behaviour of
troublesome and difficult children. When a second
| {791
</p><p>
NEUROSIS ’
</p><p>
child is born or school life begins a very spoilt child
is suddenly confronted with tasks for which he has
had no training whatever. His courage may be
taxed even more severely by a change in his
environment or the death of his#mother. If he
then tries to escape from all test situations and
evade many claims, the first nervous symptoms
will probably appear. These may take the form
of various disturbances of organ functions—
difficulties affecting the digestive organs, like
enuresis. Fits of panic and rages are also nervous
symptoms. They are intended to serve a definite
purpose, namely to compel the parents to give in
to the child and to relieve him of certain tasks.
They are the weapons which the child uses to get
his own way.
</p><p>
Fear in particular is a weapon which is employed
at some time or other by practically all children.
Children find it easiest to enlist the parents’ help
by emphasizing their own weakness. A spoilt
child who has not much confidence in his own
powers is so easily alarmed that he gives way to
wild panic the moment the slightest burden is laid
on him—though it may amount to no more than
being left alone for a short time. In any nervous
illness he develops in adult life he will probably
make some use of the weapon of fear which he
learnt to use in childhood. This explains why fear
plays such a large part in the lives of most
neurotics.
</p><p>
[80)
</p><p>
‘ NEUROSIS
</p><p>
Occasionally even school children have nervous
breakdowns. Just before they are to take an
examination they become overwrought; they
cannot sleep; their minds grow confused; they
have tremblingVfits and develop all the symptoms
of what is known as neurasthenia. Many people
go on dreaming about school examinations long
after they have grown up. Just as at school their
abilities were tested by examinations they believe
ever after that their abilities are always about to
be tested by life or the human community. All
</p><p>
“that is tested in reality is our community feeling
and our readiness to co-operate. Only the person
who gives his co-operation subject to his cutting
a good figure and who wishes to play no part
which is not distinguished feels excessively alarmed
about possibilities of failure and discredit.
</p><p>
JA nervous illness always conceals a tendency
to ‘eévdde tests which life is bound to bring.Lt The
purpose is to safeguard the neurotic againSt the
danger of discovering his own lack of value. At
first this sounds like a paradox. For just because
his nervous state makes him feel so weak and
miserable his incapacity in many fields is rendered
conspicuous. But remarkable as it may sound,
he derives a fictive increase of value from his in-
capacity, for he consoles himself for his failures by
saying: “If only I weren't such a bundle of
nerves . . . if oaly I weren’t so unfortunate as to
be ill, then . .." Whatever happens he must
</p><p>
[81] : :
</p><p>
NEUROSIS
</p><p>
preserve his idea of his own value. So though his
capacities are unimpaired, he will not allow them
to be tested. He makes his illness responsible
for his undeniable failures, but his fiction about
himself is the great obstacle f% achievement.
Further, while he excuses himszlf for achieving
nothing he increases the demands he makes on
those around him. Because he feels ill he not only
considers that he is released from obligations to
others (obligations involved in professional, social
and love relationships), but also thinks that he is
entitled to more consideration, more sympathy
and more help from his friends and family.
</p><p>
The more discouraged a man becomes and the less
fitted he feels to fulfil the requirements of life, the
more determined he will be to evade the life tasks.
His inclination to take refuge in a nervous illness
is planted long before the actual appearance of
symptoms of any kind. The moment the symptoms
arise it becomes evident that community feeling
has reached its limits and that a mistaken life plan
has come into collision with the real conditions of
life. No one can tell how much a pupil has learnt
until his knowledge is tested. Those whom life
subjects to difficult tests may come to the limits of
their community feeling sooner than others who do
not have to undergo the same tests. But in any
life any lack of community feeling must sooner or
later be revealed owing to the smultiplicity and
complexity of the relationships which human
</p><p>
[82)
</p><p>
NEUROSIS -
</p><p>
‘co-operation in any task involves. Therefore
difficulties encountered in life do not necessarily
evoke nervous symptoms. Frequently very real
difficulties change the condition of a neurotic not
for the worse, \Rut for the better. For as the
purpose of nervods complaints is chiefly to provide
excuses, they become superfluous as soon as
external difficulties seem to condone evasion.
Alarming nervous trouble often disappears at the
beginning of a severe physical illness, that is to say,
if the new illness serves as an excuse for retreat.
</p><p>
The neurotic is always an ambitious person who
has Jost courage| He lives in constant dread of
his weaknesses being discovered and all his actions
show that he is afraid. He has a typically hesitat-
_ing attitude. As far as possible he avoids making
‘up his mind about anything. So he postpones
decisions, either to gain time, or to preserve his
fictitious security at least for a moment. He tries
to hold aloof from other people and from tasks for
more than one person, because he doubts whether
, without special safeguards he can maintain himself
at all. His life is one long struggle. The tension
of his mind never relaxes. He is always on the
alert in case he should be attacked. He sleeps
uneasily and is often troubled by alarming dreams.
His inner tension may also be betrayed by purely
physical symptoms, by the blinking eyelids,
trembling fingers, reflex hyperexcitability and
exaggerated irritability and lability of the vaso-
</p><p>
(831
</p><p>
NEUROSIS
</p><p>
motor nerves which characterize most neurotics.
And because the neurotic is extremely excitable
and sensitive, he responds readily to the most
various suggestions. He is always keyed up.
Just as a balloon filled with air n1;2$ounds violently
at every touch, he makes the meaximum response
to every influence.
</p><p>
Tension plays a very important part in the
development of symptoms. Without tension most
of them would never appear at all. The symptoms
assume forms as various as man’s functions, any of
which can be disturbed either by excesses or by
neglect. The neurotic taking a subjective view of
himself may even see disturbances where there are
none, because he expects or wants to find less
strain in the use of one function or more in the use
of another, to break down a difficulty here or set
up an obstacle there.
</p><p>
Having worked himself up to a state of tension
he engages in a sham fight with himself, that is to
‘say, with the functions of his body, his motor
-system, his feelings or thoughts. He has mno
difficulty in collecting symptoms. A person can
lie awake a whole night without regarding this as
an illness, but if he gets angry or very anxious about
it or is thrown off his balance in any way, he begins
to feel ill. His struggle with himself steadily
increases the tension, without which he would
never have begun it. The tension itself was first
produced when he began to fight against his fellow
</p><p>
[84]
</p><p>
. NEUROSIS
</p><p>
beings. It grows out of resentment and resistance
to the requirements of life and above all out of fear
of discredit and defeat. If the first symptoms
produced by the struggle are suppressed they serve
to increase the ‘ension, which ultimately finds an
outlet through Xn increasing number of new
symptoms.
</p><p>
If nervous troubles affect a certain organ they
always reveal themselves in disturbances of the
function of the organ; all organ neuroses are
produced by tension. The increased strain makes
itself felt first through the regulating apparatus of
the vegetative nervous system and the internal
secretory glands which are directly controlled by
the mind.
</p><p>
Organ neuroses are often connected with an
organ inferiority. This may be constitutional or
may have been produced by faulty use of certain
organs. We still know far too little about the
importance of the child’s attitude to his functions
in life for regulating all organs through the vegeta-
tive system—even in the pathological sense. But
we know that a functional inferiority of the digestive
system may be produced either in response to a
constitutional organ inferiority or by the use made
of the organ in a struggle between a child and
anxious parents, who attach special importance to
plentiful meals and precautions intended to aid
digestion.
</p><p>
This applies to all other nervous troubles. There
</p><p>
(8]
</p><p>
NEUROSIS
</p><p>
may be a disturbance of any function. Only a
training varying in length is necessary to produce
the disturbance. Organ inferiorities may make the
process of training easier and influence the choice
of symptoms. What, however, dgcides the choice
of symptoms is not merely the/éase with which
they can be produced, but the adequacy of the
symptom complex to provide excuses. For as
every neurotic is trying to evade some task, this is,
of course, the factor which decides what symptom
ischosen. An accident may influence the neurotic’s
choice by calling his attention to the suitability of a
symptom. :
</p><p>
All views of neurosis which take the symptom as
a starting point are superficial. The various forms
of neurosis, hysteria, neurasthenia, anxiety neurosis,
compulsion neurosis, mania, organ neurosis and
sexual neurosis differ from each other only in the
symptoms they select. The inward form of the
neurosis is always essentially the same. Identical
symptoms should never be attributed to identical
causes, in view of the multiplicity of the factors
which influence each person. It is of primary
importance to discover what opportunities the
individual had in childhood for producing neurotic
symptoms, and how long the neurotic training has
lasted. People can soon ““ cultivate "’ sleeplessness,
forgetfulness, headaches, fits of depression, excite-
ment and panic. A longer trainipg is required for
more serious nervous disturbances affecting the
</p><p>
[86]
</p><p>
NEUROSIS
circulation, the action of the pulse, palpitations of
the heart and erytrophobia. The longest training
of all—a training which generally begins in child-
hood and is continued without interruption—is
required for developing compulsion neurosis.
</p><p>
Here at the e;yezry beginning the compulsion
exerted by the human community and represented
by the parents is counteracted by the compulsion
under which the child places himself and which he
apparently has to obey at an early age. This
compulsion ranges itself against the human com-
munity. As a rule compulsion neurotics, who
override all the claims of other people, regard
themselves as unusually agreeable and interesting.
For this reason it is very difficult to treat them.
Naturally they stoutly resist any attempt to make
them recognize that their behaviour is not the
outcome of a painful illness, but of a cleverly
concealed hostility to their fellow beings arising
out of their special need for significance. For with
this revelation the whole life plan of these people
would fall to pieces.
</p><p>
The neurotic’s tendency to hide his hostile
impulses towards his fellow beings helps him to
carry on a sham fight with his symptoms. Actually,
as we saw, the tension thus produced aggravates
the symptom complex. Another way of strength-
ening a neurotic line of conduct and of concealing
the neurotic’s owpn interest in the illness is provided
by the feeling of pain. This becomes all the more
</p><p>
[87]
</p><p>
NEUROSIS
apparent the less the tendency to illness deceives
others or the neurotic himself and the more he
demands of other people on the plea of illness.
Compulsion neurotics and hypochondriacs generally
have the strongest subjective suffgrings, since the
community feeling, which causes %ple to acquiesce
in social order, is most seriously injured by the
style of life they adopt. Of course, if any other
form of neurosis produces an equally violent
disturbance, the suffering which ensues is equally
severe. Pain and unhappiness always contain
accusations against the world, and substitute for
the sufferer’s own responsibility the duty of others
to help and comfort.
[88]
</p><p>
CRIME AND INSANITY
</p><p>
THE impulses wh;xh characterize both neurosis and
</p><p>
crime grow out of hostility to the human com-
</p><p>
munity. But the hostility felt by the criminal
</p><p>
appears to be very different from the hostility felt
</p><p>
by the neurotic. Outwardly the neurotic remains
</p><p>
a moral person, for he recognizes the rules of the "
buman community, while the criminal is con-
</p><p>
sciously and intentionally hostile to social order. .
It is Tiot necessary for him to deceive himself
</p><p>
regarding his tendencies for the sake of keeping a ;
clear conscience. Nevertheless the criminal tries to
</p><p>
shift YHe" responsibility for his actions on to the
</p><p>
community—on to other people. For even he is
</p><p>
bent on safeguarding his idea of his value as far as
</p><p>
possible. In fact, we find that many criminals are’
so proud of their exploits that they consider them-
</p><p>
selves better than people who appear to be more!
respectable. Above all, the criminal sets about an!
action in quite a different frame of mind from the;
neurotic’s. He takes the line of active aggression.!
He goes straight for his goal.
</p><p>
If the criminal appears to be more courageous
than the neurotic, his courage is of a strange order.
It is not the courage which finds expression in
useful achievements and makes contributions to the
</p><p>
[89] G
</p><p>
CRIME AND INSANITY
community. It is the foolhardiness of a coward,
who tries to conceal his secret despair by exhibitions
of daring, and will not admit that he is afraid. It
is the recklessness of an adventurer who stakes
everything on one card. SupeYtition appeals to
the imagination of gambler aid criminal alike.
Both believe against all probabijity that their plans
will inevitably prosper. The only difference is
that while the gambler claims the special favour of
an impersonal destiny, known as luck, the criminal
invokes this aid against 1fche whole community, the
laws and those who defend the community. The
criminal also confines his exploits to a small arena.
One proof that crimin7ls lack courage is provided
by the fact that thefy are all specialists. One
specializes as a pickpbcket, another as a burglar
and another as a forger.
</p><p>
The criminal rangeghimself against all the powers
set up to defend law and order. He defies them
just as he defied his 'guardians in childhood. If a
child becomes so rebellious and resists his guardians
so violently that he cannot be induced to accept
the laws of order at least as principles of conduct,
he will not place himself under any compulsion
which will hamper him in fighting by devcloping a
conscience. He has no qualms about using any
weapons by whiclf he may be able to wound his
guardians. The very reason why he is so free from
all restraints is that he does ndt need to excuse
himself before his own conscience, whereas the
</p><p>
[9]
</p><p>
CRIME AND INSANITY
“ nervous "’ child, who puts up a fight with himself,
makes no more than an indirect attack on social
laws and other people.
</p><p>
‘When the child makes no secret of his hostility
to society he grews hardened. He resents correc-
tion, begins to t§1 lies and perhaps to steal, for
in these ways hd appears to triumph over his
guardians. Yet people ought to realize that prac-
tically all children make a few small experiments
in lying and stealing, which provide special oppor-
tunities for teaching them the rules of social order.
Therefore wrong treatment by guardians, who
dishearten the child about such faults and deny
that he has any good intentions or feelings what-
ever, helps the child on the path to crime. On the
other hand, even when an anti-social attitude has
already been adopted, love and confidence can
awaken the dormant spirit of co-operation in the
child.
</p><p>
For even the criminal is not devoid of all com-
munity feeling. On the contrary he evinces
community feeling in the way he behaves to his
confederates. He often forms close social relation-
ships within his own particular group and is even-
prepared to sacrifice himself for this group. But
the group also has cut itself adrift from the great
human community—in fact, only hostility to the
community as a whole keeps it together.
</p><p>
Further, the cfiminal finds it impossible to avoid
contact with the community. His character shows
</p><p>
for]
</p><p>
CRIME AND INSANITY
</p><p>
the effect of the impression he has received that
he has been forced to go in a certain direction
because he “was convinced that he had been
personally repulsed by the community. He could
only become a criminal after he had given up trying
to win a position within th7 community and
compensate for his feeling of wefkness by means of
useful achievements.
</p><p>
Inordinate ambition plays a decisive part in a
criminal’s life. His sole object in fighting is to
gain significance. So people who break laws for
other reasons, such as want, philosophical motives,
etc., never develop the uncompromising character
of the confirmed criminal. The true criminal wants
to prove that he is cleverer than the community.
He prides himself on being able to outwit the police.
Every criminal acts on the assumption that he will
not be caught. This alone makes a career of crime
seem romantic and causes the confirmed criminal
to run the greatest risks of punishment. Even
the death penalty fails to deter him.
</p><p>
By resisting social order the criminal becomes
an outlaw living outside the community and
contenting himself with achievements on the useless
side of life. Similarly the insane person cuts
himself adrift from the community by denying the
reason and Jogic of the community’s laws. While
the criminal substitutes the group formed by bhis
confederates for the community" he attacks, the
psychotic creates a world which has nothing to do
</p><p>
[92]
</p><p>
CRIME AND INSANITY
with reality. He tries to gratify his desire for
importance in this fantastic world because he has
given up trying to assert himself in the real world.
The psychotic therefore represents discouragement
in its most terrible form. He gives up pretending
to take the slightest interest in useful achievement.
He severs the Ia‘.& bond uniting him with other
people. His mind no longer has anything in
common with theirs, because he ignores reason—
either in all his actions or only in some. Yet his
capacity for making contact with other people is
never quite destroyed. As soon as his environment
ceases to counter his fictive goals he can behave )
like a normal human being. !
This, of course, applies chiefly to insanity which
is not purely organic in origin, above all to schizo-
phrenia and hypochondria. * Even when a purely
sorganic psychosis, such as creeping paralysis, breaks
out it is possible to trace its connection with the
patient’s personal attitude to life problems."? We
have not yet been able to discover in what sense
organ inferiorities influence psychotics, nor to what
extent their symptoms represent weapons employed
by them in their struggle to assert themselves So
far only a beginning has been made in the psycho-
logical understanding of insanity. But at least
the characteristic symptoms of hypochondria, such
as self-reprobation, depression, etc., are known to
be means for atfaining a fictive increase in value

and for compelling other people to condone the
patient’s behaviour instead of condemning it.
Latterly Individual Psychology has not been
alone in showing that in reality the psychotic’s
attitude to the community (embodying readiness
to strive for a position in the cemmunity and to
take over useful functions, or thtz‘clontrary) more or
less decides whether the illness be cured or will
become more serious. For the successful experi-
ments carried out in connection with vocational
therapy, which was introduced by Simon (Giiter-
sloh) and has been taken up by many others, all
point in the same direction. It is to be hoped that
by means of close co-operation between institu-
tional psychiatrists and psycho-therapists it will
be possible for psychology to arrive at a complete
understanding of psychosis.

UPBRINGING .
</p><p>
THE importance of the child’s attitude to life for
developing the pex—.‘ona.lity and for defermining the
lot of each humandbeing is shown most plainly of
all in the lives of people who are failures, misfits or
minus types; that is to say in lives where the
natural development of personality -has been
frustrated by maladjustment leading to neurosis,
crime or insanity. If we recognize the importance
of attitude in this sense we must also recognize the
special importance of upbringing. This alone can
systematically influence the child’s choice of
attitude and, in fact, fundamentally determine it.
</p><p>
The potential value of upbringing is considerably
underestimated, not only by many lay persons,
but also by a large number of professional teachers.
They do indeed think it possible by educational
methods to mitigate certain faults and defects in
the child’s so-called innate character, but they deny
that education can make any fundamental differ-
ence. In support of their view they say that the
child very early develops a definite individuality
and that the child’s individuality so resists the
influences of education that all the known methods
of reward and pupishment are useless.
</p><p>
Scepticism about the value of education generally
</p><p>
[9s]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
grows out of an error regarding the age at which
the child begins to respond to educational methods.
Enough has already been said to suggest that it is
possible to begin educating the child, not as is
thought only at the age when he becomes ‘ reason-
able ", but actually on the first day of his life.
Getting accustomed to regularé;eding hours, and
learning to bear the unpleaSantness of feeling
hungry or wet represent educational tasks in the
positive sense. Mistakes in training may be made
even at this period by people who interfere with
regular habits, spend too much time looking after
the child, do not allow him to sleep long enough
and rock him or carry him about whenever he cries.
It is true that all children are not alike at birth and
that the development of some may be affected by
organ inferiorities and illnesses. But the final
effect these troubles have depends chiefly on the
treatment which the child learns to expect from
those who bring him up.
</p><p>
Some of us may wonder why this pessimism
regarding the possibilities of upbringing so often
prevails even in circles interested in education.
The explanation is found in the methods by which
people generally try to train and educate children.
Parents especially often show a very uncritical
spirit in accepting these methods.
</p><p>
A number of so-called bad habits are found among
children. We all know childres who bite their
nails, children who pick their noses, children who
</p><p>
- [96]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
hold themselves badly, children who have a
magnetic attraction for dirt. An anxious mother
will be heard scolding her child for one of these
failings on an average of a hundred times a day.
Although no success is achieved in this way, for on
the contrary the child continues to practise the
habit, it still doeiinot occur to the mother that
possibly her methdt is at fault. But we know that
if she were to ask how she could most quickly
accustom the child to an unpleasant habit like
nose-picking she need only call out when the child
chances to touch his nose, * Take your hand away—
you mustn’t do that!""—and the child will take
the very next opportunity to push his finger up his
nose. Then if she only scolds the child often
enough for subsequent repetitions of this action
they will crystallize into a habit. We see therefore
that the mother’s scolding method is calculated to
train the child in a bad habit.
</p><p>
Countless bad habits are formed by children as
the direct results of the parents’ stupidity. The
commonest reason why a small child learns to
masturbate is that the scolding method has been
employed by the parents, who “try to teach the
child better "’ if he once or twice chances to touch
his genitals in a harmless way. If a child is not
coaxed to eat there will be no difficulty about
feeding him. Anyone who fails to realize how
closely faults arg connected with faulty methods
will easily make the mistake of under-estimating
</p><p>
[97]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
or even denying the potential value of upbringing.
All that is actually proved by the failure of the
scolding method is that the method itself is useless
and even harmful, for instead of disarming resist-
ance in the child, it creates and strengthens it.
</p><p>
More or less the same may be said with regard to
most of the time-honoured metl‘fds of upbringing
which are still widely employed® The commonest
educational expedients are threatening and blam-
ing, which, if they produce the desired effect at all,
only produce it outwardly. Blame always tends
to make the child less willing to improve, and
threats only succeed in making him more head-
strong.
</p><p>
The injurious effect of blame generally cuts very
deep. If a child does anything wrong, that is to
say, does anything which violates social order, or
transgresses the rules of the community, it is
because he has ranged himself against the com-
munity or because he no longer has any confidence
in his own capacity for useful achievement. Other-
wise he would not have acted wrongly. People
misuse only those opportunities and capacities in
regard to which they do not expect much from
themselves. When the child is not hampered by
an inferiority complex he accomplishes useful
things, or learns to accomplish them gradually.
But blame only convinces the_child_that. he_was
right to doubt his capacity in a gertain direction.
Tt does not strengthen—rather it weakens his belief
</p><p>
[98]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
in his own powers, on which his success depends.
The net result of scolding may easily be that a fault,
\far from being eradicated, takes firmer root. When
a child is always being called dirty or stupid he
will feel more and more convinced of his inferiority
and find it increasingly difficult to act under any
other assumption.\ Yet practically everyone who
has to bring up chlidren seems to think that some
good result can be achieved by scolding and
humbling them. - These methods are also applied
by grown-ups to each other. They believe that
this treatment will influence people in the way
they wish, and make them conform to some appar-
ently desirable educational standard. It remains
for us to discover how they ever came to this
conclusion.
</p><p>
All those who resort to scolding try to justify
their method on the ground that it is necessary
to show people their faults so that they can correct
them. It is surprising that they have hitherto
failed to realize that their purpose can hardly ever
be achieved by the method they use, especially as
there are other more effective ways of pointing out
faults. For instance, they could make a child
aware of a fault by pointing out the difference
between good and ‘bad. Not, however, as is
usunally done, by pointing out how well behaved
and clever some other child is. No good is done
by telling Jack to,* see how nicely Tommy works !
A better plan is to emphasize the good in Jack
</p><p>
[99]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
himself by saying to him “I am glad you have
been working so well to-day." Even if there is a
danger that Jack’s devotion to work during the
day has not after all been conspicuous, he himself
knows that he has not tried as hard as he might
have done. If a child has execrable handwriting,
instead of remarking how badllhe has written an
exercise—which he probably stes for himself—it
would be better to notice how well he has written
one page, one line, one word or even only one letter.
In this way the difference between what is ugly
and what is beautiful, what is good and what is
bad, is made quite plain to the child without
discouraging him, because he is made to feel that
he really could write better.
</p><p>
Therefore the reason for the popularity of scolding
cannot be that it shows people their faults so that
they can correct them. Ratber, scolding betrays
an unconscious tendency to disparage others. The
fact is that parents and teachers frequently under-
rate children and regard them as weak, helpless,
stupid, clumsy, mischievous and perverse. Few
parents know that their children—in early child-
hood at least—are often better or more valuable
human beings than they are themselves, simply
because the children have not yet become so
discouraged as the adults. Often the children are
cleverer than their teachers. They pursue their
objectives with much more decision and above all
much more successfully. They search in every
</p><p>
' [100]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
direction for ways of reaching their goals, while
the grown-ups generally confine their choice to a
very limited number of ways and therefore cannot
expect much success. Perhaps this is why adults
are so ready to scold and disparage children.
</p><p>
Very often, also, the parents and teachers do not
feel able to cope with their charges. They feel
their responsibility towards the children but have
no faith in their influence over them, and realizing
how little they are fitted for their task of bringing
up children, they behave like most people in
difficult situations. They put the blame for their
own failure and evasion on others. They under-
value the children in order to be able to keep up
the fiction of their own superiority which is
threatened by their failures. The naughtier a
child is, the more the blame for the negative result
of upbringing appears to lie with the child himself.
</p><p>
.So whenever the adults feel unable to deal with a
child they content themselves with fixing the blame
on the child and employ numerous * educational "’
methods against the child, threatening, correcting,
scolding, forbidding and punishing without any
good effect.
</p><p>
The bad educator is characterized by his fussiness
and passion for meddling. He wants to show what
a lot of trouble he takes, so that in the event of the
child turning out a failure no share of the blame
will fall to him. -
</p><p>
People living in communities, husbands and
</p><p>
[x01]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
wives, members of the same households, people
sharing authority, people in subordinate positions,
workmates and club members, all treat their fellow
human beings in the same way as soon as they feel
weaker than them and unable to cope with them.
Anyone who feels able to win recognition from
others and does not believe }hat his prestige is
endangered by others never grasps at such weapons.
</p><p>
Fault finding and scolding are only palmed off
as educational methods. In reality they do not
serve any educational purpose. Educators employ
them merely in order to save their personal
prestige. ’
</p><p>
But there are other quite different educational
methods which really can help the children to
develop their capacities. These methods are not
content with exacting a show of obedience by the
exercise of main force ; they can train self-reliant,
capable and happy people. The whole purpose of
education is to fit the child to take part in life with
others and to help him to win and hold a position
in the community—in other words, the purpose of
upbringing is to develop the community feeling
on which success and happiness in life depend.
</p><p>
This purpose is fulfilled automatically if the
family as a whole is united and each member
willingly and as a matter of course subordinates
himself to the whole. The result of this kind of
training is that from the very®outset the child
responds readily to the community, has a place of
</p><p>
[102]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
his own and fulfils a function, which certainly
differs from the functions of the grown-ups, but
does not for this reason seem to be less valuable
or important. We can be sure that we shall never
find problems of upbringing and nervous people
in a united family.
</p><p>
Unfortunately in these days ideal families are
rare, especially in large towns. As a result
education now has to contend with greater diffi-
culties ; it is always having to remedy mistakes
already made. If a child shows signs of being
neurotic or is said to be a ““ problem * child, the
greatest care has to be exercised in order to avoid
mistakes which emphasize the difference between
the child and other members of the community.
‘Whenever a child begins to retreat in any direction
this is a sign that he is beginning to lose faith in
himself, and that he feels that he has been repulsed
in some way by the community—owing to an organ
inferiority, spoiling, snubbing or discouraging
experiences he has had in his relationships with
friends, a brother or a sister or other people. \We
ought to make it our first care to encourage a child
wher ke is in difficulty. All the child’s mistakes
are manceuvres which he makes in his struggle
against his environment and we cannot expect to
check his fighting spirit if we ourselves join battle.
Rather, we must come to terms with him.
</p><p>
It would be a great mistake, however, to suppose
that the only way of keeping on good terms with
</p><p>
[103]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
the child is by constantly giving in to him. This
will not help the child who has taken up a position
outside and against the family to find his proper
place in the community. Praise and encourage-
ment on the other hand can help him. (Of course,
we must not according to a far too common parental
practice tickle the child’s ambition and urge him to
achieve conspicuous successes’ A child who is
always being pushed is reduced at last to utter
despair.) Once the social order has been disturbed
the child will never find his place in the community
unless those responsible for his training observe
the following principle : he must bear the conse-
quences of his own asocial behaviour., We ought
to begin to apply this principle long before the
child can talk—that is to say, while he is still in his
infancy.
</p><p>
People who have to bring up children generally
work on the opposite lines. They scold, humiliate
and threaten—and the child gets his way after all.
His weapous are generally more telling than theirs.
He yells, becomes stubborn and defiant or cries.
In the end they generally give in. They have too
little patience to fight the battle out. So they
would have done better to have avoided any clash
of wills at all. If they only knew it they would
not have to talk very much or threaten the child
at all so long as they never tried to save him from
the consequences of his own actions.
</p><p>
Some parents find it very difficult to deal with a
</p><p>
[104]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
careless and untidy child. They threaten; they
try to make the child tidy by punishing and
humiliating him—all in vain. In the end the
mother herself has to put away the child’s toys
and the child is just as untidy as ever. How much
simpler it is not to say anything at all and let the
child learn for himself how tiresome it is not to be
able to find things’ that he has not put away in
their proper places.
</p><p>
Of course, when parents decide to let the child
'bear the consequences of his behaviour they must
be a little bit cunning about it and sometimes look
the other way and give him plenty of scope.
Parents can learn all they need to kmow about
cunning from their own children. There is no
exhausting children’s ideas for ways of outwitting
parents and teachers, or the schemes they evolve
for getting what they want.
</p><p>
Unreflecting people are not qualified to bring
up children. Nobody should decide upon any
educational method whatever—including any form
of reproof or scolding—before considering all the
possible effects and the feasability of other methods.
It is vain to object that there is not sufficient time
in everyday life for so much reflection. Reflection
does not require as much time and energy as is now
expended uselessly in education by people who go
the wrong way to work. But the educator can
train this capacity for reflection only by learning
to do what is far from easy—to look on quietly
</p><p>
[105] H
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
" while the child makes experiments. Nowadays
most educators suffer from anxious fear of neglect-
ing something. They cannot bear to pass over any
fault in silence. They feel that they must do
something, and forthwith proceed to do something,
even if it is worse than useless. If they would
allow a child who has begun to retreat in a certain
direction to take his way uncHecked for a while,
they would give him a chance to release pent-up
feelings and their tolerance would considerably
weaken his resistance, without which he could not
persist in his faults.
</p><p>
This capacity for observing a fault quietly gives
quite a different value to the educational methods
that are finally selected. They are sure to have
been well considered and will never involve the
parents in a struggle for personal prestige. Often
enough a simple explanation or a friendly dis-
cussion is sufficient to make a child realize the
error of his behaviour. Of course, such a discussion
should never be attempted, as unfortunately most
often happens, immediately after the child has
committed a fault, but only at a time when the
child is feeling on friendly terms with his mentor—
in quiet moments such as may occur during a walk.
</p><p>
These methods of upbringing do not make the
child feel that he is being treated as a mere cipher.
Consequently he is not impelled to resist the
educators, but looks upon them as friendly guides,
who accompany him while he takes his first steps
</p><p>
[106]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
in life. Everything which stresses the authori-
j tative position of the educators, will at the very
| least aggravate the child’s want of self-reliance.
More often, however, it creates bitter opposition.
All forms of punishment, especially corporal
punishment, and even rewards are very doubtful
educational expedients, and should be replaced by
the logic of an allfembracing order, which is not
dependent on the arbitrary will of any single
individual.
. Good educators will respect the child’s person-
' ality, love him well enough to understand his
mistakes and show kindly firmness in refusing to
save him from the unpleasant consequences of his
own conduct. They will always find ways of
reconciling the child to the social order without
arousing his resistance. When the child becomes
aware of the existence of the social order, they will
help him to fit into it ; but they will not make the
child feel that they wish to seize the opportunity
to assert any claim to personal superiority or power.
In addition, by judiciously encouraging the child
they can help many capacities to unfold—
capacities which most people still think can be
developed only in unusually talented children.
Training is all-important for developing any
capacity or talent and we cannot yet even picture
what kind of men and women will be produced in
future times when different educational methods
are employed.
[107]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
</p><p>
In the days of large families the behaviour of the
parents seems to have mattered less. A certain
system of give and take automatically comes into
being whenever a large number of brothers and
sisters have to adapt themselves to each other.
In a large family no child could help noticing
mistakes in his own behaviour, and in this way
much though not all of the '‘damage caused by
unsuitable educational methods was put right. At
least the effects of many mistakes, from which all
the children suffered equally, were mitigated.
</p><p>
In the small families of the present day the
parents’ mistakes have far more serious conse-
quences, especially as people now feel much less
certain as to how things should be done. They
approach the very difficult task of education in a
spirit of great uncertainty—all the more so because
they now admit that bringing up children is an art
which must be learnt like any handicraft, trade or
profession. Unfortunately very few parents succeed
in learning this art. They generally adopt the
methods which they saw their own parents use,
although they themselves suffered from them as
children. As educational mistakes have been
handed down from generation to generation their
injurious effects have accumulated, with the result
that at the present day education instead of helping
the child to develop very often seriously discourages
him. “ A loveless upbringingvmay brand the
child with the stigma of worthlessness. The

</p><p>

</p><p>
Draconic severity of a very harsh and strict "
upbringing intensifies the child’s feeling of helpless-
ness and dependency on the adults. A moralistic
upbringing gives an appearance of serious depravity
to the.child’s most insignificant mistakes. An
upbringing characterized by constantly changing
methods gives the child a feeling of utter insecurity.
Educators who refuse to take the child seriously
deprive him of his sense of responsibility. Dis-
couragement always has an injurious effect on him.
Coddling shelters him from experiences which
develop his capacities.""?
</p><p>
All that has been said in this chapter has referred
mainly to upbringing in the every-day home milieu.
More or less the same observations apply to
community education in institutions, kinder-
gartens and schools. Teachers can maintain order
and impart knowledge without resorting to punish-
ments and other repressive methods if they can help
the child to fit into an organized and united
community. Such a community will be suffi-
ciently magnetic to draw even a child who at first
resists it; he can be persuaded to contribute
without being compelled. The community feeling
of the children, their instinct for the rules of social
life, develop best in just these communities.
Therefore children who are in danger of becoming
ego-centric (like the only child, the youngest child,
the spoilt child and the child whose upbringing has

" hitherto been loveless) should be brought into such
communities as early as possible.
</p><p>
Individual Psychology has made the general
technique of education easy to master. But school
education freed from compulsive authority (which
is an ideal after the hearts of Comenius and
Pestalozzi) sets special new problems for teachers
to solve patiently and gradually.
</p><p>
It may seem remarkable that the decisive factors
which have to be considered in connection with
education should never have been discovered by
science until our day, for the art of bringing up
children has been practised ever since there were
human beings. Is it credible that wrong methods
should always have been employed hitherto and
that it should have been reserved for us to discover
the right methods? Here it may be helpful to
call attention to an analogy in the history of
medicine.
</p><p>
For many centuries all injured and wounded
people who were taken into hospitals had their
wounds bandaged with lint made from old linen
rags. No one knew that this lint infected the
wounds and produced complications which were
fatal to large numbers of patients until Semmel-
weiss discovered the law of asepsis, and was able
to prevent wounds from becoming infected.
Before then people were actually nursed to their
deaths by their well meaning helpers. We find a
similar situation with regard to upbringing.
</p><p>
[110]
</p><p>
UPBRINGING
Educators whose duty it is to take care of the.
children injure them most dangerously without
knowing or intending it by their wrong methods.
It may be that the new teachings of Individual
Psychology are destined to play just as revolution-
ary a part in education as the discoveries of
Semmelweiss did in surgery and gynacology. Then
and not until then pessimism about upbringing,
which may perhaps be justified under the present
system, will be silenced.
[1xx]
</p><p>
PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p><p>
PEOPLE who have been brought up in the wrong
way are very little fitted to fulfil the life tasks.
They betray their wrong attitude to the human
community by all the mistakes they make in their
lives, by crime as well as by psychosis, and above
all by neurosis. The only way to cure them is to
help them to change their objectives and correct
their attitude to their fellow beings. That is to
say, therapy has to repair the damage done in
childhood by faulty upbringing. Individual Psy-
chology has given us a therapy which has been
proved efficacious for treating both psychotics and
criminals, but naturally the treatment of neurosis
gives it the most scope.
</p><p>
All modern psychology is indebted to neurosis
because it impelled philosophers and thinkers to
make investigations which led to the discovery of
the laws of psychic life. (It need not be objected
that these laws apply to sick people only, because
they were discovered by observing these people.
In all branches of medicine we had to study the
pathological organ before we could find out any-
thing about the function of the, healthy organ).
Nervous people come the soonest to a psycho-
</p><p>
[112]
</p><p>
PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p><p>
therapist for treatment because from their stand-*
point there is something positively pathognomonic
about the feeling of being ill. Success in psycho-
logical treatment depeuds on the therapist’s power
to make fearless co-operators in life out of timid
and discouraged people. This suggests both the
possibilities of psychotherapy and the difficulties
with which the therapist has to contend.
</p><p>
If psycho-therapy is to be of any use at all it
must give lasting encouragement. It can do this
only by helping the patient to acquire self know-
ledge. Nobody need be a slave to his mistakes
and wrong objectives if he can recognize his own
responsibilities for them. The trouble is human
beings find it extraordinarily difficult not to shirk
their responsibility. Few people know themselves,
though many pretend they do. Either they are
too lazy to acquire self-knowledge or they habitu-
ally deceive themselves in order to hide their hostile
tendencies towards their fellow beings and towards
the whole community from their own consciences.
Therefore true self knowledge is very rare. On
the other hand it is just because people feel anxious
to acquire it that modern psychological works
awaken such widespread interest. By reading
psychological books a man may become able to
understand his fellow beings better and he may
even learn to see through many of his own strata-
gems, but it is very difficult for him to acquire true
self knowledge by reading only. Usually he needs

his fictive goals, extend his limited field of vision

</p><p>
The earliest memories of his childhood and his
dreams can take him a long way on his voyage of
discovery. They show the direction in which he
tends to go. The earliest memories of childhood
are always significant. They record experiences
in response to which the child developed his
characteristic attitude and there can be no doubt
that each individual tries to justify his attitude by
looking back to those experiences. It often happens
that if treatment succeeds in changing the patient’s
outlook, experiences he had kept in mind till then
are forgotten and others which he had not
‘been able to bring to mind take their place.
All memories serve to justify a definite line of
conduct which is being pursued at the time or has
been planned for the future. The human being is
constantly drawing on his memories for fresh
strength to persist in a course once chosen.
</p><p>
His dreams serve the same purpose. They are
like rehearsals showing how he intends to deal with
the tasks of the immediate future. They strengthen
his preference for retreat or pretence, and they help
him to choose his tempo and direction. His dreams
reveal many things which he willunot confess while
he is awake. This is why many people pay no

regard to their dreams. If they understood their
dreams they might find it difficult to keep up an
appearance of self-confidence.
</p><p>
The doctor encourages the patient to tell what he
remembers about his childhood and his dreams
and invites his explanations of the situations of his
childhood in order to understand the patient’s
everyday conductand find out what type of person
he is. Even the patient’s attitude to the doctor
provides an opportunity for observing how he
behaves to his fellow beings.
</p><p>
The patient finds that chance has played a less
important part in his life than he has imagined, as
most of his experiences have been shaped by a plan.
</p><p>
/ The patient is shown what plan he made when he

| prepared to approach life, and how much his

! experiences have turned on this plan. We shall
find it easier to understand the important connec-
tion between the plan and actual experiences if we
have noticed that when most cyclists first attempt
to ride alone they often run into a stone or rut,
although it really requires more skill to hit a small
point in a wide space than to miss it. They bhave
mistakenly made up their minds that they cannot
avoid it and they act on this assumption.
</p><p>
Many people doubt themselves and give way to
the feeling of not being able to act differently.
This mistake is the origin of all faulty conduct and
particularly all neurotic conduct. We can under-
stand how as a child an individual] arrived at a
</p><p>

'wrong answer when he tried to work out the
problem of his own value and why he thought he
was worth less than others in certain respects. It
is the task of treatment to correct his mistake.
Only new faith in his powers can induce the patient
to give up safeguarding himself.
</p><p>
In essence any psychological treatment is an
attempt to increase the patient’s elf confidence and
to encourage him directly or—if the treatment is
not on the lines of Individual Psychology—
indirectly. Even exposure of the fraud which
underlies the contradiction between what the
patient “ wants " to do and what he “can" do,
between his apparent intentions and incapacity
to give them effect, ultimately helps to encourage
him. He sees that his failures have not been due
to any deceptive weakness of character or equip-
ment, but that he has been mistaken as to the
nature of his intentions. The patient must recog-
nize that the symptons upon which the illness has
been built up are lines of retreat which he has
prepared. Neurosis is like a mock battle ﬁeld}
outside the war zone—a long way behind the front:
of life.
</p><p>
It is not sufficient for the patient to know how
his personality has developed. The doctor must
induce him to face the problems of his situation
at the time of treatment (his “*present problems ")
while leaving him to make decisions for himself.
Therefore the doctor’s first objective is not to cure
</p><p>
[116]

symptoms, but to persuade the discouraged patient*
to fulfil his tasks. The patient’s difficulties never
lie in the tasks themselves but arise out of his
anxiety about his prestige and his dread lest a\
failure should prove his want of value.
</p><p>
In treatment the doctor has to try to overcome
the patient’s unwillingness to face unpleasant facts.
A difficulty whicls always makes the problems of
treatment more complicated is that the patient
usually erects defences even against the doctor as
he erected them against other people in childhood
and has done ever since. The task of fundamen-
tally changing the patient’s life plan, which can
only be performed by the doctor and patient
together, is extraordinarily difficult and not at all
pleasant for the patient. As nervous people tend
to give up co-operating as soon as they have to do
anything difficult, every patient tries a number of
artifices in order to evade this task.
</p><p>
The patient does not always adopt an attitude
of open resistance to the doctor. He can make
himself just as inaccessible to treatment by
indirect evasion. For instance, the patient’s resist-
ance may be expressed by an apparent tendency
to fall in love with the doctor. The doctor then
represents only a personal value. A rdle is allotted
to him apart from his profession. The patient
is interested in matters which have little to do
with the treatraent. Another form of evasion
is practised by the patient who tries to ascribe the
</p><p>
[117]
</p><p>
PSYCHOTHERAPY
</p><p>
»doctor’s success to his personal influence. All
forms of evasion, including the tendency to ascribe
success or failure to the doctor alone, show that
the patient is determined not to modify his own
attitude to life nor to let himself be persuaded to
set about fulfilling his own tasks by means of his
own powers.
</p><p>
Here of course we can do noanore than suggest
the problems which complicate the task of the
psycho-therapist. At least psycho-therapy gives
the person whose community feeling has been
insufficiently educated " another chance". The
doctor therefore has to play the réle of educator.
And like the educator he must avoid creating an
impression of superior authority. He must never
seem to be more than a sympathetic friend helping
a discouraged person to recover his own self
confidence. Otherwise he burdens himself with
all the responsibility for the success or failure of the
treatment, while in reality everything depends on
how the patient responds. Determination to
become community-minded and willingness to
co-operate with others must put an end to the
struggle for prestige in which the patient formerly
engaged, because he contented himself with trying
to overcome his feeling of inferiority in appearance
only. There is no other cure for neurosis.
</p><p>
Neurosis is not a static indication of the extent
to which an individual has failed to develop his
community feeling. Rather it is dynamic, for it
</p><p>
[118]
</p><p>
PSYCHOTHERAPY
shows the direction in which he is moving, that is-
to say, that he is in retreat. The neurotic can be
cured if only he can be induced to abandon his
retreat from people and achievements. He cannot,
of course, expect to be perfect. He can only change
from greater to lesser error. Therefore a tem-
porary relapse into neurosis need not be taken very
seriously, unless the patient makes it a pretext
for giving up the new dircction he has adopted.

THE THREE LIFE TASKS
I
WoRrk
</p><p>
THE three life tasks, Work, Love and Friendship,
may be regarded as representing all the claims of
the human community. Ultimately right fulfil-
ment depends on the development of community
feeling and readiness to co-operate. Consequently
if one of the tasks is evaded difficulties will sooner
OT Tafer be experienced in Tulflling the others also.
Occasiomally-tt-miay Seers 45 1f one of the tasks is
completely fulfilled, while no real effort is made to
fulfil the others. The most striking examples of
this apparent inconsistency are found in the
different ways in which the same individual seems
to regard the tasks of work and love, but closer
examination reveals conflict and uncertainty and a
very superficial and insecure feeling of happiness
beneath all the apparent harmony. In the end the
apparent success and evasion can always be reduced
to a common denominator. The consistent life
plan invariably decides whether and how "any
achievement is to be attempted cr evaded.
</p><p>
Any apparent inconsistency in fulfilling the
</p><p>
[120]
</p><p>
WORK
</p><p>
three life tasks results partly from differences in the
demands they make on the community feeling
which is necessary for their fulfilment. Most people
half fulfil the occupational task. Only the most
discouraged people evade it, which is why inability
to work is often regarded as being in itself a
symptom of a serious illness. Of the three tasks
the occupational task is still the most important
for the maintenance of life, and nonfulfilment of
it almost imperils existence. Some people devote
practically the whole of what capacity for co-opera-
tion they have to fulfilling the occupational task.
Also, though they could not do their work if other
people did not co-operate with them, they are able
to maintain a certain distance in their relationships
with their fellow workers, for few people express
their whole personality in their work. The more
demand the work makes on the whole personality
the more plainly every defect of personality is
betrayed.
</p><p>
“Occupational work may be defined as any kind
of work which is useful to the community. It is
by no means restricted to work which is remuner-
ated by a wage or its monetary equivalent, but
includes the work of the housewife and voluntary
worker at welfare centres, provided that such work
is not done at irregular intervals as the individual
alone’ sees fit, but according to a certain system.
The ultimate testss whether or not useful work is
done for the community. Under our present social
</p><p>
. . [x21] 1
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS
</p><p>
system recognition of work most often takes the
form of monetary remuneration. On the other
hand the money paid to a shareholder corresponds
to no kind of occupational work. But we shall be
justified if we include preparation for a trade or
profession in our definition of occupational work.
As occupational work is characterized by the
value it has for other people,vit seems to be con-
nected with the idea of duty. It certainly deprives
the worker of some opportunities to indulge his
whims and inclinations which he had when he was
not a worker. Apart from quite small children
and old and infirm people there are few human
beings whom special circumstances exempt from
~dll occupational duties. All other people have
some kind of work to do in the interest of their
fellow beings, or have a certain necessary function
</p><p>
to perform for the human community.
There are differences in the age at which different
*people begin to have work to do. Girls are usually
giveu some duties to carry out for the family much
earlier than their brothers. The more the child
evades useful work the more difficult the occu-
pational task appears. This applies to spoilt
children whose duties the parents try to shoulder.
On the other hand it applies with equal or even
greater force to wilful and stubborn children who
succeed in evading the duties allotted to them by
their parents. By the nationalssystem of educa-
tion, however, every child is compelled to face
</p><p>
[122]
</p><p>
‘WORK
the occupational task as soon as he becomes of
school age.
</p><p>
The fact that we all have to take over duties does
</p><p>
not mean that duty is necessarily characterized by
everything that is disagreeable, as many people
think. Duties should not supersede the child’s
, games, but grow out of them in fulfilment of the
‘laws of organic development. After all, games
constitute a necessary preparation for practical life
and in this way they are also connected with
preparation for an occupation. Unless the whole
upbringing is at fault it is easy to get the child to
undertake duties which are harnessed to games.
The apparent contradiction between games and
duties exists only for adults, for the child takes his
games at least as seriously as the adult his duties.
It seems as if this contradiction must have been
suggested by mistakes in upbringing. The child
sensed that strong pressure was being brought to
bear on him and resisted it, and finally allowed
himself to be betrayed into a hostile attitude.
</p><p>
If hostility to duty develops during childhood,
it generally persists in some form throughout the
remainder of life. But it is not in the least neces-
sary to feel resentful about duty. There are many
people who derive a feeling of inward satisfaction
and happiness from the fulfilment of duty in any
form, including even the fulfilment of occupational
tasks under difficulties, whilst other people cannot
be induced to undertake any occupational tasks
</p><p>
. [123]
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS
ho matter how pleasant the conditions of work
may be. Ultimately readiness to take over occu-
pational tasks depends on the individual’s attitude
to the community. He must be community
minded if he is to find happiness in doing useful
work in the community.
</p><p>
Difficulties in fulfilling the occupational task
arise out of difficulties connected*with the problem
of personal prestige. We have seen how strongly
a feeling of inferiority can affect the individual’s
attitude to the community. The more he is
oppressed by a feeling of being weaker than the
others, the more he will try in all he does to over-
come it. He will do his utmost to influence events
in a way which he thinks will help him to win
greater significance. He will tend to think of his
work less as a useful contribution to the com-
munity than as a circumstance which helps or
hinders him in his struggle for prestige. The
feeling of inferiority may be aggravated in occu-
pations which are .regarded as menial and in
subordinate positions depending on the arbitrary
authority and " prestige-hunger " of a capricious
superior.
</p><p>
Many people are ready to put their hearts into
their work only on one condition—that is to say,
only wherr~they feel that it involves no loss of
prestige and their ambition is satisfied. They
dislike their work as soon as they feel that their
personal prestige is threatened, whether by
</p><p>
[124]
</p><p>
WORK
humiliations and slights of the most various kinds;
or by possible failures which will prove that they
are unfitted to do the work. No one who feels
! that he is being undervalued or exploited can feel
‘happy in his work.
</p><p>
If a worker begins to evade the occupational task
he does so either by skilfully and more or less
“ unconsciously “’» accumnulating difficulties which
make it impossible for him to go on working, or he
will suddenly become quarrelsome and irritable
and develop nervous symptoms which interfere
with his work. These nervous symptoms are
generally connected with mental functions—the
capacity to concentrate and quickness of observa-
tion. They may be produced by sleeplessness or
take the form of functional disturbances of the
motor system, like the cramp which interferes
with certain occupatijons, for instance, writer’s
cramp.
</p><p>
As a rule these methods of evading the occu-~
pational task are employed when failures threaten
or have already occurred. Occasionally, however,
we find an individual resorting to the same methods
immediately after he has achieved an outstanding
success if he thinks that people will now expect
him to go on achieving successes on the same level
and does not feel able to do so. -
</p><p>
Even the crucial moments at which various types
of people evade the occupational task are charac-
teristic. Some break down just before they reach
</p><p>
[125)
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS
</p><p>
their goal, others just after reaching it. This
behaviour, which is typical of the individual and
constantly recurs, can always be traced back to
the idea that his personal prestige is at stake.
Many people content themselves with insinuating
that they could achieve special successes in some
occupation but never attempt to achieve them
because they are afraid that if they do their want
of capacity will be revealed. It depends on how
much courage they have whether they turn away
from the path to achievement at the very beginning
and make it plain that they have dome so by
constantly chopping and changing from one kind
of occupational training to another, ie., by hesi-
tating between several occupations, or whether
they face about just before they reach the goal of
achievement. The worker who breaks down when
he reaches the goal or after he has reached it is
afraid of not being able to hold the position he has
gained.
</p><p>
If any nervous or characterological disturbance
interferes with an individual’s work, he will not
feel completely fit to work again until his life plan
has been explained to him and his overweening
ambition corrected by therapeutical treatment.
Naturally, any ambition which he can satisfy
without trespassing beyond the boundaries of useful
achievement will not cause any disturbance in his
life, but on the contrary will provide a special
impulse for doing extremely valuable work.
</p><p>
[126)
</p><p>
* WORK
</p><p>
‘While nonfulfilment of any of the life tasks is at
once the expression of undeveloped community
feeling and an experience which aggravates the
feeling of inferiority, failure to fulfil the occupa-
tional task—that is to say, occupational unemploy-
" ment is the heaviest burden any human being can
have to bear. The burden of unemployment
weighs most heavily on people who have met with
failures in their love life and in their friendships.
These people have no other effective way of keeping
in touch with the community. They do not know
how to feel useful except in their work. Some of
them may have utilized excessive professional
ambition as an excuse for evading the love task
or for failing to form friendships. It is very under-
standable that they should feel that the involuntary
termination of occupational employment owing to
illness, reduction of staff or superannuation spells
complete expulsion from the human community.
Sundays and holidays have a similar deadening
effect on some people. For when work no longer
provides them with an outlet, their fajlures in love
</p><p>
and friendship become all the more conspicuous.
</p><p>
[127]
</p><p>
II ’
Love
</p><p>
In contrast to the occupational task the love
task is fulfilled comparatively rarely at the present
time. On the one hand defective community
feeling can more readily reveal itself in evasion of
this task, because the consequences of evasion do
not seriously limit the chances of maintaining life.
On the other hand right fulfilment of the love task
demands a maximum of community feeling,
because it involves the closest of all contacts
between two human beings, tests their capacity for
co-operation to the utmost and destroys the
distance which can always be preserved in occu-
pational and social relationships. Further, fulfil-
ment of the love task is bound up with special
difficulties at the present time.
</p><p>
By right fulfilment of the love task is meant
close union of mind and body and the utmost
possible co-operation with a partner of the other
Isex. Such a solution of the problem can be
" reached only if each partner fully accepts the other
{and a fegling of mutual obligation grows up
}vbetween them.

and is fulfilled by only a small number of peopls.
It is obvious that people are less courageous to-days
than they were in the past. Their want of courage
is due not merely to economic and social insecurity |
but also to the smallness of most present day
families, for when there are only a few children the
danger of spoiling is much greater. We have seen
that the more discouraged people are the more
value they Set on what they regard as their prestige
and the more desperately they fight for it. To-day
the struggle between the sexes for prestige is more
bitter than it was in the past. The reason is that
the already precarious balance between man and
woman has been Violently upset of recent years.
Formerly one sex was subordinate to the other.
This inequality was always a source of sufficiently
serious disturbances to make the scales waver, for
repression always evokes resistance. Nevertheless,
the supremacy of man was so secure, owing to the
solidarity of the male sex, that woman had to resign
herself to her fate of playing second fiddle. During
the last decades, however, as a result of changes
in the economic, social and political institutions of
human society, masculine supremacy, which had
existed since civilization began, was _ggdermined.
This gave woman an opportunity for Tejecting her
subordinate réle All men and women,iadividually
were then obliged to win a position for themselves
in relation to the other sex instead of having their
position allotted to them by a hard and fast system,
[129]
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS °
Woman now seeks to obtain equal rights with man,
if she does not strive for superiority as over-compen-
sation for her past subjection Man fears to lose the
superiority which was assumed to belong to his sex.
</p><p>
So men and _women are now running after a
masculinig “ideal, which no longer corresponds to
anything that exists in reality. They measure
their own value, expressed in what they are and
do, by a standard of masculine superiority, which,
as we have seen, they set up for themselves in
childhood. This standard can only have cor-
responded to facts as they were in the time of the
absolute autocracy of man. It does not in the
least correspond to facts as they are now. Most
people have a strong *“ masculine protest *’ because
their idea of their own value compares so unfavour-
ably with their masculine ideal.
</p><p>
This masculine protest seriously hinders co-
operation between sexual partmers. Women now
revolt much more frequently and violently against
the role of their sex than they did in the days when
they had fewer rights and were kept in greater
subjection. Men, too, are troubled more than ever
before by doubts as to their own manhood, doubts
which sufficiently explain not only their horror of
marriage, but also the fear of any deep love
relationship which they so frequently betray.
</p><p>
Together with this difficulty in fulfilling the love
task, which arises out of the struggle-between men
and women for prestige, we find the problem of
</p><p>
[130]
</p><p>
LOVE
</p><p>
sexuality. Apparently, however, this second diffi~
culty is quite independent of the first. Very few
people are just as natural in their attitude towards
sexuality as they are towards any other biological
problem of natural science. K‘ﬁgﬁ vvlige_s‘!_xeg_d

“So_dgefieient—which should exist bétween man and
woman: -~ .
</p><p>
Is there any natural foundation in human modes
of thought and feeling for this special attitude to
sexuality ? It is well known that Freud thinks
that the fact of people living together under
civilized conditions, which involves the necessity
for guarding against incest, is responsible. It is at
least true that the human attitude-towards
sexuality is characterized by shame. _Shame alone
gives certain natural processes a meaning which
they would not otherwise have, and shame is
undoubtedly a_product of upbringing. There is
no natural shame. _Otherwise the motives for
</p><p>
“shame wotld nét differ in different ages and among
different peoples. Shame presupposes the exist-
ence of certain laws and rules, the observance of
which it guarantees. The educators try to train
the child to obey the established laws.
</p><p>
The purpose and origin of shame are plainly
recognizable in the view people take of.the act of
defecation. The child must learn clean habits if
he is to be propesly adjusted to civilized conditions
of life. At first he cannot control his digestive
</p><p>
[131]
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS
</p><p>
- mechanism and naturally at the same time his
interest is aroused. The object of upbringing is
to change all this. Unfortunately the method
generally employed is as unsuitable as most of the
methods employed in upbringing. The educators
try to suggest to the child that there is something
disgusting about metabolic functions and the
organs which perform them. This is the method
which suggests itself most readily to them since
they were familiarized with it through the mistakes
of their own upbringing. So they say, ““ Ugh, how
nasty ! How horrible! No, that isn’t at all nice !
You disgusting child!" The more easily and
skilfully the educators can teach the child clean
habits, the less emphasis they place on metabolic
functions and the more natural the processes of
defecation appear.
</p><p>
Children who have ranged themselves against
their parents and have some grievance against
them are inclined to frustrate the parents’ efforts
to teach them cleanliness. Educators use terms
and expressions of disgust more freely against these
children than against any others. It follows that
the clean habits which the children do finally learn
will be associated in their minds with an unusually
keen sense of shame.
</p><p>
Shame is akin to aversion and it is noteworthy
tHat aversion characterizes people who are inclined-
to resist the laws of the community. Just as shame
and aversion indicate that the child is resisting
</p><p>
[132]
</p><p>
LOVE
pressure brought to bear on him by upbringing,
these feelings are employed in later life as ready
excuses for further evasions of certain tasks.
</p><p>
The close similarity between shame and aversion
is the origin of the error which associates defecation
with the sexual function and regards & Violent
desire for defecation as part of the sexual urge.
This form of desireds created only when upbringing
places a strong emphasis on defecation. Therefore
the tendency to regard the excretory organs and
the sexual organs with similar feelings of shame
and aversion is purely and simply the result of
identical educational methods.
</p><p>
The question why do people repudiate their
sexual desires .by a trick of repression similar to
the feeling of shame which distorts their view of
the act of defecation now claims our attention.
The need for cleanliness certainly complicates the
problem of defecation, but why must people subject
their sexuality to such a strong external check ?
</p><p>
.~ We know that the Mohammedans, for instance,
have particularly strict shame laws. At the same
time we are bound to notice that their women have
been so shorn of their rights that they have been
practically enslaved. Masculine domination has
never been so barefaced as it was among the
Mohammedans until a short time ago. This is not
to be regarded as a coincidence. Subjection of one
sex is always found side by side with particularly
strict sexual laws, which operate chiefly against the

' subjected sex. So in the time of the matriarchy men
were forced into a position of shame and modesty
similar to the position allotted to the women by
our social code until the end of the last century.
</p><p>
As people did not know the real reasons, they
thought that shame belonged to the nature of
woman and attributed its existence to the wisdom
of a divine law. Only the collapse of masculine
autocracy in our time has made it clear that
woman’s greater feeling of shame has nothing to do
With her fifiction as mother, for even in the time
of the matriarchy when shame had not yet taught
hei to be submissive, she had to bear children. So
the sense of shame which society requires of woman
proves to be a means for keeping her sexually and
personally dependent on man. By demanding
virginity and forbidding intercourse outside marriage
man kept virgo intacta completely in his power. |
7 Shame laws were directed exclusively against
woman, but of course they could not fail to impose
some checks on man also, even though he showed
relatively less shame. First of all, he could not
get away from the fact that he always needed a
woman as his partner. Secondly, he was obliged
to mount guard as husband, father and brother
over woman’s honour, and lastly he was himself
the son of a woman, whose feeling of shame had
helped to confuse him when he began to acquire
sexual knowledge. v

lengthy discussion of shame in order to show that
even the social problems of sexuality turn entirely
adays when the feeling in favour of equality of
rights between man and woman is steadily gaining
ground, shame complicates sexual problems
relatively less, merely because it is no longer
necessary for kegping woman in subjection and
depriving her of rights. Already it is possible to
write and speak openly about these questions.
This in itself shows that shame has nothing what-
ever to do with a danger of incest, which, of course,
is hardly more common in our times than it was
in the past. Further, this danger does not really
exist. Children do not need sexual intercourse
with their parents; neither do healthy parents
have such desires. So the fact that human beings
live together in civilized communities is not in the
least responsible for the tendency to ban sexuality or
regulateit by a system of punishments and sanctions.
</p><p>
Nor can any responsibility for this tendency be
attached to culture. Culture is not a sublimation.,
of sexuality, but the fulfilment of man’s desireto’
overcome a feeling of weakness and inadeqiiacy.
</p><p>
The nearer we approach the goal of equality of
rights between man and woman, and the less danger
there is of subjection of one sex to the other, the
easier it will become for human beings to regard
their sexualitysas naturally and fearlessly as any
other problem of natural science.
</p><p>

</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS .
» Humanity is still under the spell of the fear of
everything sexual which has been instilled into
every child. Above all, girls can easily get the
impression from what they observe and hear and
from experiences shared with other people that
sexuality involyes a special danger for woman.
Tt is a source of disgrace and dishoiiour. Tt is the
cause of pregnancy with all its perils and suffering.
/On these grounds a prejudice against men is often
formed at an early age. Many women regard
Ahemselves as mere objects for satisfying man'’s
needs and think that he derives only pleasure and
they only harm from sexuality.
</p><p>
Adolescents will always continue to form mis-
taken ideas and magnify certain dangers they see
in sexuality until explanations of sexuality are
made as dispassionate and straightforward as the
explanations given in all the ‘other branches of
knowledge which help to fit the child for life.
</p><p>
If the educators themselves have no fear of
sexuality they need not regard the presentment of
sexuality, on which so much depends, as a difficult
task. All they have to do is to reply in language
which the child can understand to the questions he
asks at a very early age—often when he is only
three to four years old. If they adhere strictly to
the language of the child’s questions their explana-
tions will be given naturally and easily, since the
child goes on asking questions only in so far as his
understanding permits him to frame them.

LOVE
In addition to the masculine protest (which arises*
out of the doubt felt by both man and woman in
their ability to play a superior masculine réle) and
fear of sexuality, a third difficulty impedes fulfil-
ment of the love task—namely, the difficulty people
have in submitting to a union. Anyone who has
resented compulsion and dependence in childhood
easily imagines that freedom and independence
give a secure and lasting feeling of personal value,
and anyone who is conscious of being weak fears a
close union which may reveal this weakness. As
men think they are expected to play a superior
role but know how little fitted they are to play it,
well, they fear union much more nowadays than
women do. Women on the other hand require the
surrender of the man’s whole personality, and over-
estimate the value of such a surrender, because they
regard it as a pledge or token which they ought to
receive in recognition of the sacrifice they consider
they make by yielding. So the sexes turn the
. question of union into a dispute about prices, each
trying to gain an advantage over the other. In
particular, the union which involves the most far
- reaching consequences, that is to say marriage,
often proves to be of greater social and economic
advantage to the woman than it is to the man.
The wish to gain complete possession of somebody
is expressed most plainly by jealousy. Jealousy
s never a_sign of love. It only indicates fear of
not being able to hold another person. "~

* The rdle of virginity is nowadays complicated
by special difficulties connected with sexuality and
the real or imaginary sacrifices demanded by union.
Although society no longer requires women to
practise chastity so strictly as in the past, the
transition from virginity to womanhood still
represents an insoluble problem for many women.
They fear the step which makes them complete
women. This is, of course, due both to their
upbringing and to their attitude to sexuality.
The dread of losing virginity is particularly marked
in women who regard everything sexual as beastly
and degrading and therefore resent the manifesta-
tions of their womanhood, as for example menstrua-
tion. (This resentment is the origin of many
menstrual and premenstrual disorders.) On the
other hand the man no longer regards virginity as
\an estimablé or particularly valuable quality of
Xv::)manhood. This, of course, is only because he
</p><p>
ishes to evade responsibility, because he fears
that too close a tie will bind the woman to him,
and because—unlike men in the past—he does not
want to play the part of the first man in a woman’s
life. (So he voluntarily surrenders the most
characteristic position of masculine supremacy).

.evasion of the real solution, and so many mistaken
experiments and évasivé afrangements are made
by married and unmarried partners.
</p><p>
People betray their want of courage even in their
choice of a love partner. We have only to observe
how the feeling of love grows and declines to
realize over and over again that the human being
is not controlled by irresponsible urges, as he likes
to think. In reality his intentions control his
apparently automatic " urges . People are easily
deceived by an alleged contradiction between
emotion and reason. If they cannot justify their
intentions by an appeal to reason they say that
emotion and reason are irreconcilable and they
rely on an emotion, which appears to be independ-
ent of their will, and therefore irresponsible, to
execute their intentions. Sexuality.is by nature
without _direction. The direction it egm
takes depends entirely on the individual’s choice
of a personal goal.
</p><p>
Many people drift into unhappy love affairs,
chiefly because they are capable of loving only
while real union is impossible. They give the
impression that they would like to take steps to
fulfil the love task. In reality they have no inten-
tion of doing so. Instead of admitting that they
are at fault in some way, they pretend that they
are the victims of their emotions—victims of a
fate which stands between them and fulfilment of
their desire. Desire and emotion are strongest
</p><p>
[139]
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS :
When the individual is least prepared to take any
step in the direction of a real solution. No love
seems so passionate as unrequited love, or the love
that can never hope for fulfilment because external
circumstances make a union impossible. The
wildest erotic fancies fill the minds of people who
are anxious to evade every practical possibility
of a union. In their day dreamsd¢hey go on a quest
which they never undertake in real life. On the
other hand their emotion usually begins to decline
as soon as it becomes possible for them to realize
their ‘“ wishes". In this way they show how
skilfully they can use their emotion as a weapon
for resisting the discipline of a union and for
evading reality. Often a love emotion vanishes
altogether if the danger of a close union arises. A
desire for distance may cause one partner to draw
away from the other. This is what happens in
marriage when distance, which could be maintained
previous to marriage, is inevitably decreased by
cohabitation.
</p><p>
A particularly clear example of the way in which
emotion can be employed for creating distance is
to be found in the tendency to feel an inclination
for more than one person at the same time. This
is sometimes regarded as an argument in favour
of the view that some human beings have dual
personalities. The reason why people so often
seem to find their physical ideal i one person and
their spiritual ideal in another is that they do not
</p><p>
[140]
</p><p>
LOVE
</p><p>
wish to give themselves completely to either, and
so are determined to go only halfway in recognizing
either. The tendency to create distance in a
marriage may be expressed by a sudden passion
for a third person. The Don Juan type uses every
new love emotion to end an old liaison. It may
be that the Don Juan and the vamp owe their
numerous conque$ts to the fact that they are the
most unsuitable partners to have.
</p><p>
In particular, all perversions show how people
choose wrongly in order to evade the love task. A
long training prepares the way for these perversions
and accustoms the naturally blind sexual urge to
objects which make a natural love choice impossible.
Likewise, people who say that they are incapable
of experiencing love emotions or allege the impossi-
bility of finding a love partner show that they
intend to evade the love task.
</p><p>
Even if a successful love choice is made and leads
to marriage or a union outside marriage, the
subsequent history of the relationship often shows
how perverse the choice really was. It is not at all
rare for people to choose and assign a value to their
partners chiefly on account of their faults (though,
of course, they do not admit this) so that later on
they can shift the whole blame for disaster on to
the partner. So many people have tob little self
confidence to try to find lasting happiness in love.
They feel all th® more uncertain of themselves if
in childhood they saw how difficult the love task
</p><p>
[141]
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS
</p><p>
could be. It is natural for children whose parents
live unhappily together to overestimate the diffi-
culty of this task. In their caution they choose
unwisely and give their love to somebody who
fulfils their desire for superiority or security. We
may be sure that the man who accuses his wife of
want of independence chose her for the very reason
that her need for someone to lan on made his
superiority apparent, and that the man who
comgplains that his wife is masterful and tyrannical
reg chose that kind of wife because she looked
aftér him, took all responsibility off his shoulders
and mothered him.
</p><p>
Under cover of illness also people may attempt
to evade a union or to create distance after a union
has been consummated. Illness as a mode of
evading the love task includes perversions like
sexual impotence and frigidity, which are not
STgamic in origin and are tRErRIQLg forms of Feurosis.
</p><p>
Courage to accept a partner of the opposite sex
is necessary for fulfilment of the love task. This
suggests an answer to the question : What is love ?
Desire and acceptance of the partner are identical.
If the partners accept each other desire is awakened,
and, unless it is intended to keep open a way of
retreat, leads to fulfilment of the love task. The
partner is fiot then regarded as a mere object, but
is joyfully accepted as a fellow human being.
Love is a task for two. When two people com-
pletely find each other the problem is solved.

FRIENDSHIP
</p><p>
No one is ever in touch with the whole human
community. Each individual is connected with
only a few people, but in his relations with them he
expresses his attitude to the whole community.
Once we know how a man gets on with the;&-er
members of his family and his fellow w s,
whether he has many friends and how much trouble
he takes in order to enjoy the society of other people
we have the key to his personality and know more
or less what to expect of him. The human being
"has to establish social relationships and come into
contact with other people in order to satisfy an
everyday need. The way he behaves to other
people is a most trustworthy indication of the
quality of his community feeling. If many people
whose community feeling is comparatively un-
developed fulfil the occupational task relatively
well and if on the ather hand people with the
average amount of community feeling nowadays
encounter special difficulties in fulfilling the love
task, each person’s social relationships reflect
faithfully his attitnde to the communmity. No|(
external pressufe compels fulfilment of this task
as of the occupational task; on the other hand,
</p><p>
[143]
</p><p>
THE THREE LIFE TASKS ¢
it is not complicated like the love task by diffi-
culties which go deeper than ordinary human
relationships. Everyone is free to decide whether
and to what extent he will form friendships, adapt
himself to friends and co-operate with them, or
whether he will choose solitude and detachment.
He uses his judgment spontaneously in these
matters. Therefore the way iy which he fulfils
the task of friendship is the best measure of the
strength of his community feeling.?
</p><p>
A man who makes a muddle of his social relation-
ships will, of course, try to excuse himself before
his own conscience, as he does when he fails in the
other life tasks. He will blame the mistakes of
others for his own mistaken conduct. He may be
inclined to regard all other people as worse than’
himself—more selfish, more disagreeable, more
difficult to get on with. This attitude is adopted
by people who are conscious of any kind of
deficiency when they compare themselves with
others and feel that they cannot quite keep pace
with them or compete with them. They can even
make a virtue of an inferiority by attributing their
failures to their " fineness of feeling ', their good-
nature, or some other supposed quality. In the
end they withdraw into a " splendid isolation "
and seem to think it worth their while to break off
their friendships with other people, because the
other people deserve nothing better.

FRIENDSHIP
</p><p>
A hostile attitude to the community may be con
cealed beneath pseudo-ethical or philosophical ideas.
It is not at all unusual to find a small clique closing
itself against the community. Properly developed
community feeling is ready to recognize the needs
of a community beyond and above every small
group. The small group is generally actuated by
selfish interests and tends to range itself against
the community just as the neurotic ranges himself
against his fellow human beings. Family solidarity
frequently helps to strengthen feelings that are
hostile to the community. A love union may grow
out of the partners’ common hostility to other
people. It may be a union which seems to offer a
complete solution of, the love problem, but no
attempt is made to solve the problem of wider
social relationships. The apparent solidarity of
these narrow associations, which are formed from
motives of hostility to the great human community,
recalls the semblance of solidarity found outside
the human community among criminals.
</p><p>
Interest in other people also leads us to make
efforts to understand universal problems which
unite large groups of people. So the individual's
attitude to politics is typical of his attitude to his
fellow beings. A man who holds aloof from all
political discussions, and does not try to.help in any
active or positive way to solve the problems of the
community, and so does not support any of the
existing political movements, betrays his lack of
</p><p>

THE THREE LIFE TASKS :
fnterest in universal problems. He may excuse
himself on the ground that all the political pro-
grammes are inadequate and that political life is
full of absurdities and abuses. If he were really
community minded he would be willing to co-
operate even when things are not done just as he
thinks they should be done. We never find a.
community, a movement or a system of thought
which entirely corresponds to our views. No one
who is continually emphasizing how much he differs
from other people and regards the differences as
all-important will be able to co-operate. The
individualist arrives at his intellectual and
emotional conclusions by a private logic, which is
biased by secret hostility to other people and
amounts to hostility to the whole community.
</p><p>
Reserved feelings may be concealed by exaggera-
tions in social relationships just as easily as by any
other tricks. Many people who are very active in
politics and other spheres are actuated less by social
interest than by will-to-power, and many ultra-
sociable people are secretly lonely and isolated.
Even the hail-fellow-well-met person can make it
impossible for other people to get any idea of what
he is really like by keeping his inmost thoughts,
feelings, conflicts and problems to himself. He
takes refuge in sociability in order to evade more
significant human relationships, whether in his
family or in a circle of friends, v

EPILOGUE
ANYONE who has grasped the simple truths npon
which Individual Psychology has been built up
soon realizes why people under-rate it and why
acceptance of it involves certain difficulties. It
provides a set of very simple tools for investigating
complex character formations. Simplicity charac-
terizes the fundamental laws of community feeling,
its counterpart the inferiority feeling (which is the
source of all striving for significance), the unity of
the personality and, the individual life style.
Whoever refuses to allow himself to be convinced
that such laws govern all the activities of the mind
forgets that fundamental laws have always proved
to be simple in essence though applicable to complex
modes of life. One has only to think of Newton's
law of gravitation, which enabled so many varieties
of motion of inanimate matter to be deduced from
the same fundamental formula. It is not surpris-
ing, therefore, that it should be possible to apply
the fundamental laws discovered by Alfred Adler
to all psychological manifestations. How little
justification there is in the accusation that these
laws fail to take equipment and the part played by
the instincts into account is shown in the chapters
this book devotes to those subjects.
(1471
</p><p>
EPILOGUE
</p><p>
* All these objections have a deeper significance.
It is evident that the teachings of Individual
Psychology are intelligible to all, and many people
even agree with them so long as no personal
problem appears to be attacked. The findings of
Individual Psychology win their assent when they *
refer to other people, but they try to feel sceptical
and raise objections as soon as their own behaviour
comes under observation. They object that our
laws cannot explain everything. Yet it is signifi-
cant that each one takes exception to something
different while readily assenting to statements
which another person has difficulty in accepting.
Whoever has deeply explored human nature will
have no difficulty in understanding this. Everyone
refuses to understand what does not agree with his
life plan and involves the recognition of his own
responsibility. This explains why people are
constantly emphasizing the special importance of
the equipment and the instincts. They represent
the greatest limitation of individual responsibility.
</p><p>
Our critics behave like our patients. Patients
assent without much difficulty while the laws of
individual conduct are being stated in a general
way. But the moment any scientific statement
seems likely to have a personal application their
understanding halts. And when they are no longer
able to deny the logic of our arguments they try
as a last resource to explain thei# standpoint by
saying : ‘' Practically everything you say is true,
</p><p>
[148]
</p><p>
EPILOGUE
</p><p>
but all the same there must be something else which®
ought to be taken into account." This attitude
may be observed in patients even after an un-
deniable cure with cessation of the symptoms has
been wrought. The five per cent which these
patients regard as excepted from the laws of
Individual Psychology is intended to enable them
to fall back on ihe old excuses of illness and
inability, etc., whenever in a new set of difficulties
they see a favourable opportunity for doing so.
Only exposure of this fraud makes it possible to
destroy the fiction of a residuum which has nothing
to do with personal responsibility.
</p><p>
Thus both in general discussions and in psycho-
therapeutical treatment Individual Psychology
arouses the most violent resistance the moment it
establishes as a fact the responsibility of the
individual. The knowledge it gives is not so
comforting as other teachings, which maintain
that the character of the individual is determined
by such factors as heredity, organic changes
occurring in the nervous system, the development
of instincts, external circumstances, environment
and economic and social burdens. Anyone who
tries to excuse himself is always finding fresh
opportunities for doing so, and in order to refute
the unwelcome statements of Individual Psychology ,
he can always refer to contrary systems of thought.
‘Who can tell whéch system is right ?
</p><p>
The question of objective knowledge represents
</p><p>
- [149]
</p><p>
EPILOGUE
</p><p>
an extraordinarily difficult and complicated pro-
blem of metaphysics. Apparently there is no such
thing as an absolute truth. It seems that reason
originated as a weapon which was employed by
man in his struggle for existence—in his endeavour
to overcome his natural weakness. So each human
being still employs reason as a weapon and recog-
nizes it only as it helps him to,reach the goal at
which he is aiming. Faced with two scientifically
established psychological principles which flatly
contradict each other, no one can determine with
certainty how much truth and how much error
one of them contains. We reach our decisions
subjectively, or a chance opportunity may help
us to become more closely acquainted with a certain
idea, or we decide in favour of an opinion because
it agrees with our own views—which are determined
by our own problems.
</p><p>
So we know what to expect when we have to
treat a patient who has undergone a previous
course of treatment based on another system of
psycho-therapy. Such a patient may welcome the
teachings of Individual Psychology. They are new
to him and explain much that formerly seemed
unintelligible. But sooner or later comes the
moment when the patient resists. May not our
way of logking at things be wrong, seeing that
so-and-so maintains something quite different ?
Experience shows that this attitude merely indi-
cates that we have now touched upon a problem
